c                                           a note about the seeds:
c                                               1st value: is the "seed", which can optionally become the seed for a seed if 2 and 3 are non-zero.
c                                               2nd and 3rd value: the number of times a seed generator is called based off of the
c                                               first value, such that the number of times, N = 2nd + (3rd * 10^9).
c                                               The seeds are assigned to the various parts below in the order they appear:
