If you change the coast version in ./src, update ./build.sh to reflect that
change.

If you need coast-interface packages (customizations), uncomment and edit line 6 of ./build.sh

Otherwise, just run ./build.sh to build corsika2root.

(be sure to source /your/path/to/root/thisroot.sh before running ./build.sh)

(also, coast only works with a ROOT version < 6. see
https://github.com/ealbin/root to "easy" install another ROOT version if you
need to)
