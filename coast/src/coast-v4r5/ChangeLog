The COrsika data AccesS Tools is a bundle
of C++ code, that helps accessing the 
CORSIKA binary data. 

COAST can do two major things:

- Read CORSIKA files in binary format and 
  auto-detect thinning/not-thinning and 
  some machine-dependent fortran steering
  marks.

- Link directly to CORSIKA (using the ROOTOUT version)
  and prevent the binary data file from being created.
  The data can be handled in any way right at CORSIKA
  run-time.


There are a selection of use full tasks for COAST:

- use ROOT to make custom plots while you are running CORSIKA

- write CORSIKA data directly in any user defined format

- convert CORSIKA binary data files to any user defined format
