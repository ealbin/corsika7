COrsika data AccesS Tools 

is a software package to support the access and manipulation of CORSIKA data
both, as stored in binary data files, but more importantly also during the
air shower simulation process itself. For example it allows users to link a
COAST user library to CORSIKA that can handle every particle tracking step of
CORSIKA, etc.

The software was initiated in 2005, and is now well and regular
supported by CORSIKA and is used, for example, for the generation of
radio emission simulations with CORSIKA based on REAS2 and REAS3 (see
Astropart.Phys.27:392-405,2007)

It is also ideally suited to study air shower properties, as for
example electromagnetic shower universalities (see e.g.
Astropart.Phys.31:243-254,2009)
