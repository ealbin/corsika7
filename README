1) Start on master branch:
    
    $ git checkout master

2) Compile COAST (see ./coast/README for customizations):

    $ cd coast

    $ ./build.sh

3) Source COAST (edit ./coast-init.sh to reflect any customizations above):

    $ cd -

    $ source ./coast-init.sh

4) Compile CORSIKA (optional, for easy reference, record your choices in SELECTED_OPTIONS):

    $ cd corsika-76900

    $ ./coconut

Optional 5) If you try to compile the NEXUS hadronic interaction model, it
might error on function "sbet".  This function doesn't appear to do anything
as it isn't called by any other line of code.  To dissable it so NEXUS will
compile:

    $ ./fix-nexus.sh

    ** Caution: only do this once! Repeating this will only clutter 
       ./corsika-76900/nexus/nexus-uti-3972.f
