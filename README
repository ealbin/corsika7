1) Start on master branch:
    
    $ git checkout master

2) Compile COAST (see ./coast/README for customizations):

    $ cd coast

    $ ./build.sh

Optional 2a) (only needed if you want to compile COAST with your CORSIKA build
-- i.e. you have some customizations from above) 
    
    Source COAST (edit ./coast-init.sh to reflect any customizations above):

    $ cd -

    $ source ./coast-init.sh

    Your options should appear when you do step 3) now, but if they don't you
probably haven't sourced /your/path/to/root/thisroot.sh (version < 6).
    If you have, you can try to force things as an alternate 3):    

    $ cd corsika-76900

    $ ./coconut --enable-COASTUSERLIB=yes

    or

    $ ./coconut --with-COASTUSERLIB=yes


3) Compile CORSIKA:

    $ cd corsika-76900

    $ ./coconut

Optional 4) If you try to compile the NEXUS hadronic interaction model, it
might error on function "sbet".  This function doesn't appear to do anything
as it isn't called by any other line of code.  To dissable it so NEXUS will
compile:

    $ ./fix-nexus.sh

    ** Caution: only do this once! Repeating this will only clutter 
       ./corsika-76900/nexus/nexus-uti-3972.f 

Final remark 5) If you're having trouble getting your option to appear with
./coconut, you can try to force it by editing ./corsika-76900/include/config.h
