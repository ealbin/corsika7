1) Start on master branch:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/ealbin/corsika7.git


2) Make your own analysis branch:

    $ git checkout -b work


3) Source your build of ROOT (version <6)

    see https://github.com/ealbin/root if you need to install ROOT.


3a) If you want to work with ROOT file output, I would recogmend compiling
with the option "ROOTOUT" in coconut despite CORSIKA's recogmendation to use COAST, 
as COAST's "corsika2root" program struggles to process output larger than a few
gigabytes.

    Proceed to step 4.


3b) If you want to use COAST's specialized tools, briefly check out
./coast/README.  If you just want corsika2root, you can do:

    $ cd ./coast/

    $ ./build.sh

    You'll need to source coast-init.sh any time you want to compile CORSIKA
    with your tools (beyond corsika2root)
    
    $ source ./coast-init.sh

    $ cd -

    Proceed to step 4.


(*) A note about COAST: the "coast" that comes with CORSIKA (./v77000/coast)
actually doesn't work -- it hasn't been compatible with CORSIKA for several
versions.  The COAST that does work has to be aquired separately (i.e. what is
in ./coast).


4) Compile CORSIKA:

    $ cd v77000

    $ ./coconut

    
(**) If you are compiling with a COAST tool, or trying to do ROOTOUT, your options 
should appear when you run coconut provided you have sourced
./coast/coast-init.sh and/or sourced your "thisroot.sh" for ROOT version <6.
However, you can try to force things as a last resort:    

    $ ./coconut --enable-COASTUSERLIB=yes  --enable-ROOTOUT=yes

    or

    $ ./coconut --with-COASTUSERLIB=yes --with-root=yes

    or

    edit ./v77000/include/config.h


(***) If you try to compile the NEXUS hadronic interaction model, it
might error on function "sbet".  This function doesn't appear to do anything
as it isn't called by any other line of code.  To dissable it so NEXUS will
compile:

    $ ./fix-nexus.sh

    NOTE!: only do this once! Repeating this won't ruin anything, but will clutter 
          ./corsika-76900/nexus/nexus-uti-3972.f needlessly
