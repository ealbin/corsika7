This subroutine contains various utilities to read binary files produced by 
CORSIKA. The fortran files usually depend on the options choosen (thin, 
multithin, history) while the C++ files are more flexible:

            * a "coast/" subdirectory containing COAST based utilities
              BEST CHOICE FOR BEGINNERS (see below)
            * a C++ routine to read the binary particle output file
              (corsikaread.cpp),
            * a Fortran routine cors2input.f to reestablish the used
              input from the binary particle output file,
	    * 3 Fortran routines to read the binary particle output files
              (corsikaread.f, corsikaread_history.f, and corsikaread_thin.f) 
            * a Fortran routine corsplitevts.f to split a large particle
              output file into several files containing single events each,
            * a C-routine map2png.c to visualize shower plots established 
              with the option PLOTSH2.
            * a Fortran routine modelprint.f which displays the used 
              high-energy and low-energy models from the binary particle
              output file,
            * a Fortran routine (plottracks3c.f) and its include file 
              (work.inc) to visualize shower plots established with the 
              option PLOTSH.
            * a Fortran routine readcsk2asci.f converting a binary
              particle output file into a (readable) ASCII file,
            * a Fortran routine readtimes.f to sum up the CPU times of 
              several .lst files (useful at parallel runs),
            * 2 Fortran routines showsimprods.f and showsimulist.f to 
              establish a tabular of several simulations giving 
              characteristic values of each simulation 
              (primary-id, energy, angles of incidence, ... ) 
              from the binary particle output files,
            * a Fortran routine sumlistnkginfo.f to sum up the NKG-output 
              of .lst files to get XMAX averaged over the used showers,
            * a Fortran routine sumlongifiles.f to sum up the content of 
              several .longi files (also in case of parallel simulations),
            * a Python program "gdastool" to create some atmospheric
              profile readable by CORSIKA from GDAS database,
            * several other shell scripts and data handling programs to
              treat the CORSIKA output files.

Please read the source file to have more informations.

In the "coast" subdirectory, there is other more modern tools to handle binary
CORSIKA files. They are using COAST libaries to allow an easy link to ROOT and
a easier way to extract selected variables from the CORSIKA output file.
More examples based on COAST are available in coast/Documentation/Examples/novice/. If COAST is installed (see coast/README in this directory), a simple "make" will compile these examples.
