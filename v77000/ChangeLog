           The PHI vector meson is produced in full analogy with the
           omega meson. The intensity of the vector mesons 
           rho(0) : omega : Phi is assumed to 9 : 0.6 : 0.4
           The decay of the Phi meson including rare decays leading
           to mu+mu- pairs is performed in subroutine RESDEC.

           In the THIN option with the CERFIL keyword in combination 
           with the CEFFIC or the CERWLEN option the wavelength (instead
           of the weight) may be demanded. 
           Modifications in Cherenkov option allow to use telescopes 
           without IACT option. The output of each telescope may be 
           written in separate CERnnnnnn-teliii files (rsp. 
           DATnnnnnn.cher-teliii for MCERFI >= 3)  where iii gives the 
           telescope ID. 
           Correction of EDEP1 to avoid spikes in the longitudinal
           energy deposit distribution. Also negative contents in the
           last energy deposit bin are repalced by zeros.

           Coupling with updated DPMJET3.0 in connection with PHOJET1.12
           and PYTHIA6.427 (all files made available by A. Fedynitch).
           Update bernlohr package to version 1.50
           RIGIDITY rejection of low-energy primaries dependent on the
           primary zenith and azimuth angles (for GRAPES experiment at
           Ooty, India)
           In the EFIELD option the electric field acts now - besides 
           on electrons and positrons - also on the muonic and hadronic 
           particles.
           In the CERLDE subroutine a bug is corrected which happens 
           only in the combination of options CURVED&&SLANT.
           Slant depth calculation in function THCKSI improved by 
           increasing the number of points (from 500 to 8000) for
           interpolation between slant path bins.

           Remove bug which affects unexpectedly the x and y
           coordinates of resonances when its starting and end point in 
           the SLANT longitudinal distribution are determined. This bug
           was only for simulations with SLANT and CURVED and
           longitudinal calculation active, It had minor impact except
           with the new Sibyll 2.3 for which resonances are decayed in 
           CORSIKA.
           Improve link between CORSIKA and CONEX for longitudinal
           profile.

           Coupling with Sibyll 2.3rc4a.f of F. Riehn, which includes 
           charm production. Can be used without CHARM option rsp. with
           CHARM option. Needs updates in routines/functions BOX2, 
           PYTSTO, and all corsika-sibyll link routines (SIBDAT, 
           SIBINI, SIBLNK, SIBSIG, SIBSTR, SIGNUC_INI2, S_RNDM).
           Update bernlohr package to bernlohr-1.49.
           Additional modification for herwig6521.f needed to avoid
           identical subroutine names UPINIT and UPEVNT with PYTHIA 
           routines. HERWIG code is now included in CORSIKA package
           High energy photonuclear reactions done with rho0 projectile
           for EPOS and SIBYLL.
           Changed default value for ELMFLG/FEGS = .true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Introduce new generation counter including EM interactions.
           Done always but full information available only with EHISTORY
           option. Now without EHISTORY generation counter saturates at
           99 indicating that EM particles come from muon decay.
           Various bug corrections.   
           Improve range calculation in CURVED+UPWARD+NEUTRINO  for 
           neutrinos which are produced with skimming incidence to reach
           the border of the atmosphere in any direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Rare decay   rho(0) ---> mu(+) + mu(-) (B.R. = 4.5E-5) 
           has been added to the subroutine RHO0DC which is now called 
           also from RESDEC.
           Rare decay    K0s ---> pi(+-) + mu(-+) + (anti)nu_mu 
           is added to get the high-energy muons and muon neutrinos 
           steming from this decay.
           New options ICECUBE1 and ICECUBE2 to meet the requirements
           of the IceCube experiment. 
           ICECUBE1 treats the stack of secondary particles (which 
           usually handles LIFO) differently in FIFO mode which enables 
           to shorten a shower if only low-energy particles are in the 
           stack which are no longer interesting for the production of 
           high-energy neutrinos. The threshold energy is defined by 
           the keyword EINTER (interesting energy). This may shorten 
           the simulation time considerably.
           ICECUBE2 offers two modes how to handle the particle data
           output file: With the keyword COMPRESS the output file is 
           compressed by the gzip procedure. With the keyword PIPE the
           output file is written into a buffer which is on-line used
           as input for a detector Monte Carlo program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Correct serious bug (in case of TMARGIN.eq.T) as the position
           and time coordinates of primary must be reset at beginning 
           of each shower in the shower loop.
           Introduce new keyword NUADDI to give additional info on 
           neutrinos.
           Introduce new keyword CORECUT to discard particles arriving
           close to the core from output; it works with and without 
           thinning and should be used to reduce size of particle output
           data file.
           Introduce new MULTITHIN and AUGERHIT options.

           also for CURVED & UPWARD.
           Include new rare decay mode (eta --> mu+ + mu- + gamma) which
           is an additional channel for high-energy muons > 100 TeV.
           Introduce more option details in binary file name.

    have been made in CURVED+UPWARD options to make them much more 
    reliable and stable.

    VENUS4.12/5,FLUKA2005.6, GHEISHA_2002d, URQMD_1.3cors, HERWIG6.510)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	A time limit is introduced (keyword TIMLIM) in the CURVED version
    to cut away particles to be scattered around and consuming unnecessary 
    computing time.  The argument of TIMLIM is the distance the particle 
    may be followed downstream before being cutted.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.450                    (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-397,

    VENUS4.12/5,FLUKA2005.6, GHEISHA_2002d, URQMD_1.3cors, HERWIG6.510)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Several smaller improvements have been made in the combination of
    the options CURVED with UPWARD within routines UPDATC and UPDATE to 
    avoid that particles run out of the atmospheric region. 
	The angle addition routines ADDANG3 and ADDANG4 have been improved 
    by a fast renormalization to avoid that the direction cosines become 
    unnormalized (otherwise their square sum becomes > 1 and causes 
    unpredictable errors).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.400                    (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-397,

                FLUKA2005.6, GHEISHA_2002d, URQMD_1.3cors, HERWIG6.510)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	New installation process without CMZ (GNU-like).  CMZ is not needed 
    any more.  A shell script "corsika-install" is used to properly call 
    ./configure to install the binary file of CORSIKA in the run/ 
    subdirectory.
	CURVED and UPWARD options can now be used together allowing any 
    zenith angle also for hadrons.
	The new ROOTOUT option is available and distributed with the COAST 
    package to get the CORSIKA output in a .root file.
	The new PLOTSH2 option allows to visualize air showers with .png 
    files (thanks to the C-program "map2png"). 
	The new CERWLEN option includes the wavelength dependent generation 
    of Cherenkov photons and respects their wavelength dependent 
    refraction within the atmosphere. 
	FLUKA 2005.6 is now linked to CORSIKA.  
	QGSJET-II(-03) and NEXUS-397 are now officially distributed with 
    CORSIKA.
	Bernloehr package v1.34 included.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Within the routine FILOPN the statements for opening the
    PLOTSH files were misplaced which truncated the file names. Replacing
    the OPEN statements corrects this.
        The PLOTSH plotting of track segments of primary em-particles before
    the first interaction is now prohibited except for setting of TMARGIN
    by key word TSTART.
        To implement the skimming entrance of primary particles the new
    keyword IMPACT has been introduced. The minimal altitude of the shower
    with horizontal movement is selected at random with uniform
    distribution between HIMPACT(1) and HIMPACT(2). Within the routine
    INPRM the primary parameter THETAP is derived from the minimal height
    HIMPCT of the shower axis above sea level.
        For Linux CMZ installation without the default name cmcc.c for
    extracted C-language routines a CMZ command has been added to the deck
    'make' deck to guarantee this name cmcc.c .

	The longitudinal distribution of Cherenkov photons has been
    improved avoiding jumps in the distribution when the step of a charged
    particle is interrupted by the passage of an observation level.
    This implies a complet rewriting of CERLDE and eliminating CERLHA,
    affected are also $CEREN2 and CERENK.
        For the THIN option the PLOTSH output files have been extended to
    contain the particle weight for each track segment.
        The option PLOTSH2 developed at Leeds by F. Schmidt has been taken
    over and adapted for compatibility with all interesting other
    options available.
        Many modifications have been made to enable a combination of the
    options CURVED with UPWARD to cover the whole zenith angular range.
    Routines essentially affected are AAMAIN,COOINC,DATAC,INPRM,
    PRANGC,THICKC,UPDATC,UPDATE,ELECTR,HOWFAR,PHOTON.

                    FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002d, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	For em-primaries the timer was started in the curved version
    erroneously at the first interaction instead at the top of atmosphere.
    This is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.311          (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03, QGSJET01C,
(not released, June 2005)           QGSJET-II, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	In the HERWIG link accidentally the random sequence # 1 was used
    instead of the correct one # 5.
        The thinning of hadronic particles coming from EGS4 is revised.
    Consequently their thinning is performed only in TSTEND which implies
    the elimination of THIN2 and a renaming of routine MPPROP to the
    simplified routine MUPROP. Also routine SHOWER is affected.
        The energy loss of charged particles by ionization is calculated
    more precisely taking into account the maximum transferable energy to
    electrons, which gives an additional term
    - 0.5D0 * LOG(1.D0 + 2.D0 * GAM * RATM + RATM**2)
    with RATM = M_elec/M_hadr

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The possibility to select the cross sections independently from
    the interaction model is not reasonable. Therefore the options
    DPMJETSIG, NEXUSSIG, QGSSIG, SIBYLLSIG, and VENUSSIG have been
    eliminated. The essential reason for this actions is a considerable
    simplification of the nesting of the CMZ optional code for easier
    maintenance of the program.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.307          (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03, QGSJET01C,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The GHEISHA link routines have totally been converted to double
    precision in all REAL variables, so a linking with the double precision
    version of GHEISHA2002d is necessary.
        The QGSJET II-1 has been replaced by QGSJET II-2 and the QGS-link
    routines adapted to the more advanced version (COMMON qgarr54/qgarr55).
        In the case of thinning the weights of gamma-induced moun pairs,
    rho and omega-mesons or single pions (emerging from low-energy pion
    production) had been calculated too high. This bug in routine
    THIN2 is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.306          (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03, QGSJET01C,

                     FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	In the PRESHOWER version the arrival times of the particles had been
    incompatible with the altitude of the first interaction (by conversion
    above the atmosphere). This is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.305          (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03, QGSJET01C,
(not released, Feb, 2005)           QGSJET-II, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                     FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The updated interaction model QGSJET II-1 has been coupled with
    modifications of the QGSJET link routines. QGSDAT01 is replaced by
    qgsdat-II, SECTNU is replaced by sectnu-II.
        To avoid a 'floating exception' in BOX2 by converting a value of
    CHI > 2.E9, the size of CHI is limited to 2.e9.
        The treatment of muon nuclear interaction and continuous energy
    loss of muons by nuclear interactions is corrected. Up to now both
    processes have been respected simultaneously which gave a too large
    energy loss of the muons. Now the the hadronic cutting energy is
    taken as transition energy (lower rsp. upper boundary for DADMUL
    integration) between both processes. Affected routines are DNIELM
    and DNUSGM.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.304                     (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03,
(not released, Jan, 2005)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                      FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The option `upward' has been extended to hadronic and muonic
    particles, also in combination with `slant', but not yet in combination
    with `curved'.  Affected routines are AAMAIN, BOX2, BOX3, DATAC, INPRM,
    MUTRAC, PRANGE, and UPDATE.
        Some smaller inconsistencies in the energy balance caused by
    upward going particles in upward going showers (leaving the atmosphere)
    have been corrected in HOWFAR.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.303                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,
(not released, Nov, 2004)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                      FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The structure of the particle arrays CURPAR, SECPAR, PRMPAR, OBSPAR
    has been mofified to introduce 3 direction cosines instead of the
    COSTHE and PHI. The advantage is an easier handling of horizontally
    and upward going particles (3 directional cosines are used in the EGS
    portion of CORSIKA since ever). The particle identfication is now
    contained within CURPAR(0), the gamma factor (resp. energy) within
    CURPAR(1), the direction cosine in z-direction in CURPAR(2), the new
    direction cosines PHIX and PHY are stored in CURPAR(3) and CURPAR(4).
    Two new routines ADDANG3 and ADDANG4 for angle addition replace in
    most cases the former angle addition routine ADDANG. Therefore many
    minor modifications have been necessary.
        All masses, decay constants, branching ratios etc. have been
    updated according with the Particle Data Group edition 2004.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.302                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,
(not released, Oct, 2004)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                      FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3c, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The electronuclear interaction has been added to the EGS routines.
    This effects essentially the routine ELECTR and some commons.
    A new routine ELNUCL treats this interaction. The cross section and
    branching ratio files EGSDAT are renamed to EGSDAT5_x.x  to make the
    difference in the data structure visible in the name.
        The updated low-energy interaction program UrQMD 1.3c is now linked.
    This update improves the CPU time by a factor 15

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   Starting from version 6200, most of the improvements up to
 version 63xx have been taken over as soon as they became known.
========================================================================
   For the THIN option the PLOTSH output files have been extended to
   contain the particle weight for each track segment.
   Within the routine FILOPN the statements for opening the
   PLOTSH files were misplaced which truncated the file names. Replacing
   the OPEN statements corrects this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.204                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,
(released, June.15, 2005)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                      FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the combination of options PRESHOWER and CURVED the azimuth angle
   PHI was not set correctly for the primary momenta component calculation
   to be used in the eventheaders EVTH(8), EVTH(9) and EVTH(12).
   In the HERWIG link accidentally the random sequence # 1 was used
   instead of the correct one # 5.
   To ensure a correct linking of CORSIKA with qgsjet01c.f the name
   of the subroutine PSASET has been modified into PSASETC in corsika6204
   as well as in qgsjet01.c. This avoids an accidental combination of
   corsika6204 (unpacked for qgsjet01c.f) with the older qgsjet01.f
   which works without crash, but delivers strange results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.203                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,
(released, Apr.19, 2005)            QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                      FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3, HERWIG_6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the case of thinning the weights of gamma-induced moun pairs,
  rho and omega-mesons or single pions (emerging from low-energy pion
  production) had been calculated too high. This bug in routine
  THIN2 is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.202                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the PRESHOER version the arrival times of the particles had been
   incompatible with the altitude of the first interaction (by conversion
   above the atmosphere). This is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.201                  (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-02/03,
(released, Mar.22, 2005)            QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Some smaller inconsistencies in the energy balance caused by
   upward going particles in upward going showers (leaving the atmosphere)
   have been corrected in HOWFAR.
   The treatment of muon nuclear interaction and continuous energy
   loss of muons by nuclear interactions is corrected. Up to now both
   processes have been respected simultaneously which gave a too large
   energy loss of the muons. Now the the hadronic cutting energy is
   taken as transition energy (lower rsp. upper boundary for DADMUL
   integration) between both processes. Affected routines are DNIELM
   and DNUSGM.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.200                     (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03,
(released, Oct. 06, 2004)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                       FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3, HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A bug in the SLANT option has been eliminated by modification of
   function THCKSI to guarantee a value within the allowed range
   0 =< THCKSI =< TSLANT(IENDT).
   The interactiontest is extended to get a 2-dim histogram for
   P_t vs. rapidity to verify experimental p_t data.
   The initialization LNGHSTINI of the longitudinal histograms in the
   ANAHIST version is now separated form the filling routine LONGIHIST.
   The link routines of DPMJET, QGSHET, SIBYLL and VENUS have been 
   modified in a manner to suppress diffractive events in the case of 
   photonuclear interaction. A corresponding modification of NEXUS-link 
   is not possible as the diffraction is permanent in NEXUS. In HDPM the
   diffraction is anyway switched off for photo-nuclear interactions.
   The high-energy extrapolation of the photonuclear cross sections 
   has been modified, replacing the old Gaisser(1985) parametrization by
   the recent Cudell parametrization (given by the Particle Data Group).
   This affects only the data sets EGSDAT, which are now renamed to 
   EGSDAT4_x.x .
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.182                     (coupled with DPMJET-II.55, NEXUS-03,
(not released, July 2004)           QGSJET01C, SIBYLL-2.1, VENUS4.12/5,
                       FLUKA2002, GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1.3, HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The UrQMD link has been totally renewed and simplified. It is now
   adapted to the UrQMD version 1.3.
   The longitudinal particle distribution has been extended to get 
   the distributions for a series of hadronic particle species separately
   (nucleon, charged nucleon, uncharged nucleon, charged pion, charged 
   Kaon, K0l, K0s, neutral Kaon).
   A clean-up of the Auger histograming routines has been made to 
   eliminate unnecessary calculations. The size of some histograms is
   reduced to reasonable values, some new histograms (releasable energy 
   vs. dist.) are defined. The new particle longitudinal distributions
   are also available as histograms. A list of the used histograms is 
   now printed in the standard output.
   The linking of the PRESHOWER routines is improved to enable their
   use in combination with CURVED and/or SLANT.
   The PRESHOWER routines have been modified to get rid of routines
   from 'Numerical Recepies'. The Bessel function is now a specialized
   version of CERN mathlib routine DBSKA.
   Erroneously in the PRESHOWER option the EVTH block was not written 
   to the output particle file. This is now cured.
   The energy cut ELCUT(4) up to now exclusively used for gammas
   is now used also for the pi(0) energy cut.
   In the CERENKOV+CURVED option a serious bug concerning the 
   refractive time correction in the last altitude bin has been 
   eliminated. For easier maintenance the arrays DISTEF and TOF have
   been redefined with shifted indices (now starting at 0).
   In the upward version without setting FIXHEI the number of 
   longitudinal steps always was set to reach sea level. This is
   now corrected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.176                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,
(not released, Feb  2004)          SIBYLL-2.1, QGSJET01C, DPMJET-II.55,
                         GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA2002, URQMD_1, HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The continuous energy loss by muon nuclear interaction is now added
   according to Bottai & Perrone, which needs changements within MUPINI
   and adding the routines DNIELM and VPHL. The muon interaction routines 
   MUBREM, MUPRPR, and MUNUCL are now improved in so far as after a very 
   long muon transport step (occurring at very inclined showers) the cross
   section is checked again, and the interaction is skipped eventually.
   In the calculation of the energy deposit of deuterons, tritons and 
   alpha particles within subroutine CGHEI the rest mass was taken with a
   faulty particle identifier. This is now corrected.
   If a muon undergoes nuclear interaction  the remaining muon with 
   reduced energy was not written correctly to stack and therefore lost. 
   This is now cured.
   The name conventions of the PLOTSH output files has been changed
   to DATnnnnnn.track_em, DATnnnnnn.track_mu, and DATnnnnnn.track_hd,
   which are written to the directory specified by DIRECT.
   Some COMMON arrays of QGSJET have been enlarged to get the 
   correct high multiplicity of Fe-air collisions without limitations
   by array sizes even at 10^20 eV. The modified qgsjet is renamed 
   to qgsjet01c.f. In the make file for the CMZ-selection a suitable 
   option is provided to get the modifications in the qgsjet link 
   routines with the enlarged COMMON block AREA14.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.175                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

                         GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA2002, URQMD_1, HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A severe bug has been detected: The modified Bottai&Perrone 
   routines treating the muon interactions (bremsstrahlung, pair 
   production and nuclear interactions) give the cross sections in barn, 
   while the CORSIKA routine BOX2 needs it in millibarn. 
   The more frequent treatment of muonic interactions may lead to 
   endless rejection loops within the routines MUBREM, MUPRPR and 
   MUNYUCL. This is now prevented/controlled by rejection loop counters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.173                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

                         GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA2002, URQMD_1, HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A new option STACKIN has been implemented. By reading in the
   parameters (type, energy, momenta) of secondary particles emerging from 
   an interaction of any exotic primary the resulting shower is simulated. 
   The altitude of this interaction has to be specified by FIXHEI.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.172                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,
(not released, Dec  2003)           SIBYLL-2.1, QGSJET01, DPMJET-II.55,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A new option SLANT is introduced which enables the production of
   longitudinal distributions at slant depth (replacing the vertical 
   depth distributions of the standard case). This needs some new 
   subroutines and functions: DGAUSS, PATHSI, RHOSL, THCKSI, THCKSL.
   In a first the option SLANT cannot yet combined with option UPWARD.
   Some smaller inconsistencies (negative rest mass for antinucleons,
   etc. ..) have been corrected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.163                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The finalized preshower C-routines are now available in the patch
   PRESHOWER together with the IGRF Fortran routine to calculate the
   magnetic dipole field of the Earth. Smaller modifications have been 
   applied to subroutine PRESHO for a correct linking of these routines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.162                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A serious bug in the constants used within the LPM routine 
   LPMEFFECT has been corrected. For gamma-induced showers this lowers
   the onset energy by about the factor 2.
   The upward option within the EGS routines has been extended to 
   enable a combination of upward with curved.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.156                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Erroneously the energy deposited at the detector level by electrons
   and photons was counted twice (within ELECTR/PHOTON and additionally
   within OUTPT1). This is now corrected.
   The FLUKA link routines have been extended to include the 
   include files of the Linux version with the correct name which is 
   included in brackets. The make file respects now the Linux version.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.155                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Five new atmosphere parametrizations have been implemented:
   Four for different seasons at Malargue, Argentina (Pierre Auger 
   Observatory), and one as a new parametrizations of the U.S. standard
   atmosphere, all parametrized by B. Keilhauer.
   Small inconsistencies in the FLUKA link have been removed.
   The unallowed leading tilde in a dataset name is now checked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The treatment of muonic interactions has been completely revised
   by adapting the routines of Bottai and Perrone to the CORSIKA 
   program. New or significantly changed routines comprise:

   MUPINI, MUPRPR, PPCE, PPCS, VBSE, VBSS, and VPHM.
   Major changes concern the cross-sections at muon energies
   exceeding 100 TeV, the sampling of muon-produced e+e- pairs,
   and the muon nuclear interactions. The latter makes use of the 
   EGS routines PIGNE, PIGEN1, PIGEN2 ...  Therefore now always 
   two seeds have to be usd. To initialize the EGS-parameters
   without reading the EGSDAT file the EGSINI routine is split into
   EGSIN1 (setting the parameters) and EGSIN2 (reading EGSDAT file).
   The energy loss of muons by Bremsstrahlung and pair production below
   the energy cut is now included in PRANGC, PRANGE, and UPDATE.
   Using the FLUKA option to avoid confusions when starting several 
   jobs at a time from the same directory, the FLUKA output files 
   (fort.11 and fort.15)  may now be redirected to /dev/null or to  
   files called DATnnnnnn.flout and DATnnnnnn.flerr to be written to 
   the same directory as the particle output file.  This redirection
   is steered by the keyword FLUDBG.  This required a separation of the 
   OPEN statements from the subroutine INPRM into a new routine FILOPN, 
   which is called from START after reading the NUCNUCCS cross sections.
   To enable the correct treatment at the highest energies above 
   10^20 eV with extreme high secondary particle numbers some array 
   dimensions should be enlarged.  Index overflow of those arrays is now 
   controlled (error stop), the arrays easily may be redimensioned by 
   modifying the parameters for defining the array sizes.

Version 6.150                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,
(not released, May 2003)            SIBYLL-2.1, QGSJET01, DPMJET-II.55,
                          GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA2002, URQMD_1,HERWIG6.400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A new option NUPRIM is added to treat primary neutrinos. The first
   interaction is treated with HERWIG, which must be coupled for this
   purpose. This implied a renaming of CORINC into COOINC.
   The new random generator has been improved at those routines where 
   only single precision random numbers are used (to prevent random 
   numbers becoming 0. or 1.). Consequently the name has been changed
   to RMMARD.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.146                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A new random generator RMMARD with ENTRY RMMAQD is now used 
   throughout within CORSIKA and the coupled interaction models. 
   This generator combines the multi-sequences of RMMAR with the double 
   precision feature of RM48. Tests revealed bit-identical sequences for 
   RMMARD and RM48.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.145                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-03,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The linking of FLUKA has been improved taking advantage of the
   Fluka built-in direction cosines to reduce the computing times.
   Modified neXuslink to fit with neXus3. The PNLL has been 
   corrected in NEXLNK and VENLNK (missing beta in the formulas).
   The PLOTSH output files are refined including now the time
   at begin and end of each tracing segment. Therefore the parameter 
   sequence in the PLOTSH output files is modified.
   To adapt to various combinations of high- with low-energy hadronic
   interaction models, the parameter HILOW may be set also for the
   standard CORSIKA version.
   The erroneous clipping of the specific energy loss of electrons
   at energies below 300 keV has been eliminated. 
   The reset of STACKINT is now performed before entering the shower
   loop to avoid unnecessary computing times.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.142                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, FLUKA, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   By some correction patches (obtained by R. E. Cassell and G. Bower,
   SLAC) the energy conservation of GHEISHA has been improved considerably.
   The corrected version of GHEISHA is now called GHEISHA2002.
   Thanks to G. Battistoni and A. Ferrari (INFN, Milan) linking
   routines to the low energy hadronic interaction routines of FLUKA could
   be established. A link with the object code library of FLUKA is
   necessary when using the FLUKA routines in combination with CORSIKA.
   Because of duplicate names all CORSIKA commons have been renamed by
   adding a "CR" at the beginning of each CORSIKA common name.
   Also the names of some constants have been changed slightly.
   For UrQMD the coupling of K-induced interactions has been improved 
   taking into account the mixing of K(0) and K(0)bar to K(0)s and K(0)L.
   The target selection within GHEISHA has been improved to enable 
   the targets (p, 14N, 16O, 40Ar, 99air) in the INTERACTEST option.

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A new CMZ option AUGERHIST is added, which enables the generation
   of histograms along the shower development at 20 observation level 
   for various particle species.
   The tables for energy deposit have been disentangled to get 
   separately the energy deposed because of energy cut and that because
   of angular cut and a Gaisser-Hillas fit to the ionization energy
   deposit is performed additionally.
   A new CMZ option UPWARD is added, which enables the transport
   of em-particles in upward direction, i.e. no angular cut is applied.
   This new option should not (yet) be combined with CURVED.
   A new CMZ option ANAHIST is added, which enables the production
   of histograms for a standard analysis without producing the
   particle output file (by using PAROUT f x) thus saving disk space.
   A new CMZ option PRESHOWER is added calling a C-routine package of
   P. Homola (Uni Krakow) which simulates the generation of a gamma
   induced preshower within the Earth's magnetic filed well above the
   margin of the atmosphere.

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To get better numerical stability throughout the program the
   calculation of trigonometric functions sin = sqrt(1-cos**2)
   is mostly replaced by sin = sqrt( (1+cos)*(1-cos) ).
   Similar replacements have been made for analogue expressions.
   To extend CORSIKA to charmed particles the particle codes of charmed
   mesons and baryons have been defined together with tau and 
   tau-neutrinos in close analogy with the particle codes used in DPMJET.
   Decay times are now collected within the table DECTIM and all masses,
   charges and life times are initialized in subroutine PAMAF.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the CERENKOV+CURVED option a serious bug concerning the 
refractive time correction in the last altitude bin has been 
eliminated. For easier maintenance the arrays DISTEF and TOF have
been redefined with shifted indices (now starting at 0).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The more frequent treatment of muonic interaction may lead to 
endless loops within the routines MUBREM and MUPRPR. This is now
prevented.
   In the calculation of the energy deposit of deuterons, tritons and 
alpha particles within subroutine CGHEI the rest mass was taken with a
faulty particle identifier. This is now corrected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.030                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A severe bug has been detected: The routines SIGBRM and SIGPRM
for the muon interaction cross sections (bremsstrahlung, pair 
production and nuclear interactions) give the cross sections in barn, 
while the CORSIKA routine BOX2 needs it in millibarn.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.023                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the curved version the arrival time started not as intented at 
the margin of the atmosphere. This inconsistency is now corrected.
   Some smaller inconsistencies (negative rest mass for antinucleons,
etc. ..) have been corrected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.022                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A serious bug in the constants used within the LPM routine 
LPMEFFECT has been corrected. For gamma-induced showers this lowers
the onset energy by about the factor 2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.021                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Erroneously the energy deposited at the detector level by electrons
and photons was counted twice (within ELECTR/PHOTON and additionally
within OUTPT1). This is now corrected.
   The unallowed leading tilde in a dataset name is now checked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.020                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_2002, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The erroneous clipping of the specific energy loss of electrons
at energies below 300 keV has been eliminated. 
   The reset of STACKINT is now performed before entering the shower
loop to avoid unnecessary computing times.
   In subroutine VAPOR the sometimes occurring residual nucleus of 
a di-neutron is now treated as two neutrons.
   For vertical showers simulated with the CURVED option a 'divide
by zero' could occur within function NRANGC. This is now cured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.019                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the case an em-particle is the primary and penetrates through
the total atmosphere without interaction, no eventheader is written 
to the particle file. This is now corrected.
   In the subroutine CERENK with the CURVED option the quantity ETA1
is used without being initialized, which finally causes wrong 
parameters of the Cherenkov output photons. This bug is now fixed.
   Using CURVED in combination with the ATMEXT option the routines 
PRANGC, NRANGC, and THICKC employed different atmospheric 
parametrizations at the same time in mixed mode, which gave incorrect 
longitudinal distributions of hadrons, muons and electrons. To prevent
this in the ATMEXT option in combination with CURVED now parameters 
AATM, BATM, CATM are fitted to the external atmospheric tables and 
used further on in the program, disabling the ATMEXT option after the 
fitting procedure.
   For vertical showers simulated with the CURVED option a 'divide
by zero' could occur within function THICKC. This is now cured.

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The function FINDTH which selects the azimuthal angle in the
VOLUMECORR version has been revised by its author.
   Possible hang-ups in ELECTR and PHOTON in the CURVED version have
been eliminated by limiting the step size when approaching the detector.
   In the CURVED version particles with pathes ending above the
detector height in the local frame but below the detector plane in
the detector frame are now brought to output (UPDATC).
   In case of radial thinning the counting of particles in the 
EVTE(3) ... EVTE(6) does not take into account the radial thinning.
This is now improved by adding EVTE(263) ... EVTE(266) which
give this information including the radial thinning. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(released, September 10, 2002)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In the curved option the height of the first interaction as given
in the event header EVTH(7) was not calculated very precisely (with 
deviations up to some kilometers for very inclined showers), which 
resulted in unwanted time shifts, if the particle arrival times should 
be given relative to the arrival of speed of light on shower axis.  
(The time differences among the particles came out correctly.) 
By a new programming of the function THICKC this inconsistency is 
now eliminated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A revised version of the bernlohr package (version 1.16) has been 
implemented (June 5, 2002).
   In the CURVED version the range estimation of particles has been 
improved to get a correct fictive arrival point even below the 
observation level (routines NRANGC and PRANGC). Particles below
the detector plane are brought consequently to output.  Also the last 
bins of the longitudinal particle output are now filled correctly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.015                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The inconsistency in the printout of 'AVERAGE HEIGHT OF 1ST INT'
(which gave for hadronic primaries the slant depth instead of the 
vertical depth) has been eliminated.
   The occasional occurrence of QGSJET interactions producing no
secondaries and thus violating the energy balance is eliminated
by resimulating those events (changements within QGSLNK and QGSTOR).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.014                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

                                    GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   An inconsistency in the treatment how the energy deposit of particles
going below the energy cut is handled has been eliminated. This needs
changements in routine UPDATE and all routines which call this routine.
   A serious bug in the muon tracking of the CURVED version has been
eliminated. Dependent on the zenith angle this error caused an
enlargement of the number of muons arriving at ground by 20%.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.012                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,

   Erroneously in the CURVED version the Earth's magnetic field is not 
switched on for hadrons and muons, while the electrons are tracked
correctly. This bug is now fixed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To get a more continuous distribution at small electron/positron
energies in the pair formation, a sampling procedure has been changed
within routine PAIR (rsp. PAIRLPM).
   An error in filling the dbase file 'model+crossect' with interaction 
model sibyll is eliminated.
   An error resulting in incorrect tracking of muons which do not reach 
an observation level, but produce Cherenkov radiation and cross an 
atmospheric layer boundary, is eliminated. The error affects only the
longitudinal energy deposits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   An inconsistency in the Sternheimer correction has been detected
when using EGSDATA sets ranging down to energies below 3 MeV.
Depending on the data set a correction term 'sterncor' has to
be subtracted to get the saturation of DEDX correctly as function of
energy and air pressure.
----- CORSIKA 6006 ----
   To meet the requirements of the condensed output format of the
STACEE experiment the CMZ option STACEE has been introduced, which
needs the combination with CERENKOV, THIN, and CEFFIC.
   Minor changes in DPMJET shortened the longitudinal shower
development significantly. The changements concern the CORSIKA linking
routines, the packages dpmjet251.f (now dpmjet255.f) and dpmjet252.f
(now dpmjet256.f). To express this changements, the new version got
the numbering DPMJET II.55.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A revised version 1.10 of the bernlohr package has been made
available by K. Bernloehr. The physics and programming did not 
change, while the documentation and `make' files are updated. 
   Because of serious problems (producing NaN for the particle
coordinates) with GNU compilers and egcs-2.91.66 compilers using
compiler optimization, the transport of charged particle through a 
magnetic field has been reprogrammed. This affected the calculation 
of the quantities U12, V12, W12, U22, V22, W22 in subroutine UPDATE 
and the quantities U(NP), V(NP), W(NP) in subroutine ELECTR. 
   Some smaller inconsistencies in the scattering of Cherenkov
Telescopes are improved, including the Bernloehr package.
   In the THIN version the occasional exceeding of weight limitation 
by particles emerging from routine PIGEN2 has been prohibited by
reprogramming PIGEN2 and introducing a new routine PIPROP (which
acts rather analogously with MPPROP).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   An error in calculating the energy deposit of em-particles into
the last bin of the longitudinal distribution has been removed.
This affects also the energy balance.
   Unused portions at the end of the output RUNH and EVTH blocks 
in the THIN version are filled with zero's.
   The different development of electron-induced sub-showers in the
NKG-treatment is now respected by adding 0.6 rad. length in elongation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To enable an individual scattering of the shower axis across a
Cherenkov array for each shower within a run, the calling of the
quasi-random generator is moved from INPRM to AAMAIN. Also
the scattering depends now on the random seed of the Cherenkov option.

taken over correctly. 
   Check of input file: The maximum run number is now checked to 
prevent uncontrolled write to files with undefined names. Tabulators 
used as separators are replaced by `blank'. The debug-diagnostics of
input file is improved (DEBUG-statements in the DTC... routines).
   Elimination of bug in the EGS-reject mechanism of low energy 
subshowers starting at high altitude. (This error did not affect 
simulations with CERENKOV, THIN, PLOTSH options, or with LONGItudinal 
development selected.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.00                       (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,
(released, Dec. 14, 2000)             SIBYLL-1.6, SIBYLL-2.1, QGSJET01, 
                                     DPMJET-II.5, GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The DPMJET interaction model has been replaced by the more recent 
DPMJET version 2.5 (Nov. 99). The link routines have been adapted.
Also new hadron air cross-sections are parametrized and K-air inelastic 
cross-sections have been added.
   To meet the requirements of the Auger experiment a CMZ option 
enables the selection of differing formats of the .dbase file. 
With this new formats this file is renamed to DATnnnnnn.info .
   To overcome azimuthal asymmetries of muons caused by GHEISHA
for each GEISHA interaction a random azimuth is added. This needed
some modifications in subroutine CGHEI.
   Diffraction of QGSJET98 is slightly modified to QGSJET01,
needs new data set QGSDAT01.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.947                      (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-02,
(not released, Oct. 2000)             SIBYLL-1.6, SIBYLL-2.1, QGSJET98, 
                                     DPMJET-II.4, GHEISHA_600, URQMD_1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Together with the Y2K problem nearly all computing systems now have
the 'date_and_time' routine available. Thus a combination of the former
CMZ options DECUNIX and LINUX to the new UNIX option is an indicated
simplification. For systems with differing RECL parameter and time
routines in the UNIX option, the BYTERECL and OLDDATE options are
possible. Only in special cases the TIMERC option may be used to get 
the timer.c routine. The usage of the correct RECL parameter is now
checked by the routine RCLCHK.
   The C-routines of K. Bernloehr are now kept as a separate package
compressed by .tar and .gzip; this package contains also various 
atmprofi.dat and auxiliary files (README, make, ...)
   The new option VIEWCONE has been introduced. It permits to
select the primary incidence angle from a circular region around
a fixed zenith and azimuth angle in a manner with correct probability
density. The inner and outer opening angle of the cone is specified 
by keyword VIEWCONE.
   The new option COMPACT enables a more compact particle output file
especially suited for very low energy simulations, where no or only 
very few particles arrive at the detector level. By the COMPACT 
option (keyword COMOUT) only abbreviated event headers of those 
events are written, which also produce particles. Tailing zeros 
in the data blocks as well as event-end blocks are suppressed. 
The compact output may be switched off using the key word COMOUT.
   The updated interaction model SIBYLL_2.1 needed a revision of 
the linking routines. By the option SIBYLLOLD the link to the old
SIBYLL_1.6 is selected. Debug output of the SIBYLL_2.1 link routines 
is switched on using the second parameter of key word SIBYLL.
   To select the old qgsjet98.f to reproduce the physics of the 
old qgsjet.f, the option QGSJETOLD is implemented. The only 
difference is the treatment of nucleus-nucleus cross-sections, 
which formerly were treated by the NUCNUCCS Glauber tables, while 
now they are done by the routine SECTNU of qgsjet98.f. The QGSJET 
option is now selected by QGSJET (instead of QGS). 
   The low energy interaction model UrQMD is now available (for 
Karlsruhe internal use only) which might overcome the problems with
GHEISHA. The link to this model is selected by the URQMD option,
which might be combined with all high energy interaction codes. 
In some combinations double existing names of commons, functions,
or subroutines have to be eliminated. Debug output of the URQMD 
linking routines is switched on using the second parameter of 
keyword URQMD.
   To reduce the CPU time and output of Cherenkov simulations,
in the CEFFIC option the atmospheric absorption, mirror reflectivity, 
and PM quantum efficiency are respected in an early stage of the 
Cherenkov light simulation. With the keyword CERQEF all three
processes can be enabled or disabled separately. Suitable tables
must be read in via unit 20. New subroutines  ATABSO, CESPEC, 
LINEAR, TELEFF, and TPDINI have been added.
   The THIN version has been extended by implementation of weight 
limitation (WMAX). Radial thinning for particles arriving within
core distances < RMAX is added. The input parameters WMAX and RMAX 
are additional parameters of the THIN key word.
To enable a thinning level for em-particles differing form the
hadronic thinning level and with differing weight limit WMAX, 
a new keyword THINEM is introduced with parameters THINRAT 
(ratio e_th_em/e_th_hadr) and WEITRAT (ratio w_max_em/W_max_hadr).
   The zero point for the particle arriving time may be changed from 
the first interaction (default) to the entrance point of the primary
into the atmosphere by the keyword TSTART. This needed changes 
within MAIN, ELECTR, and PHOTON. With the start point at entrance 
into the atmosphere, also the generation of Cherenkov photons before 
the first interaction is possible, and the particle then suffers from 
ionization energy loss, magnetic deflection and multiple scattering 
already after the starting point.
   The CMZ-make file has been adapted to the available options and 
the incompatibilities among them.
   A Y2K bug in writing out the creation date on the .dbase file 
has been corrected.
   Parametrization of pair and brems-cross-sections for muons
above 10^5 GeV corrected.
   Some inconsistencies in the transport of em-particles have been
corrected in the curved-version of HOWFAR and CORNEC.
   Errors in the subroutine GETBUS modifying the arguments of this
routine have been eliminated.
   The call for system routines of day and time has been adapted to
various hosts, the make file has been extended by appropriate  
selections.
   The longitudinal distribution of particle numbers and energy
deposit can be written to file DATxxxxxx.long if the flag FLONGOUT
(keyword LONGI) is enabled. If this flag is disabled, only the 
particle longitudinal distribution is written out to the particle 
output tape in separate blocks beginning with `LONG' (similar to 
`RUNH', `EVTH', `EVTE', and `RUNE'). 
   The longitudinal distribution of Cherenkov photons can be 
calculated in `differential' form (# of photons generated in a 
longitudinal step, default option), `integral' form (# of all 
photons generated above lower border of step; CMZ-option INTCLONG; 
compatible with the older versions), or may be suppressed completely 
(saving CPU-time; CMZ-option NOCLONG).
   The fitting procedure of the longitudinal parameters has been
improved to a 2-step algorithm; in the first step the first 4
parameters are fitted, in the second step these values are used as
starting values for the final fit. In average better chi**2
are obtained also at distributions gained with severe thining.
   SAVE statements are used throughout the CORSIKA program to enable
a compilation with Linux-GNU compilers g77 with optimization -O.
Also the QGSJET, VENUS, and GHEISHA programs are now equipped with 
SAVE statements. All calls to UCOPY and VZERO have been eliminated
from the GHEISHA routines. 
   An inconsistency in writing the last block of the Cherenkov 
output file has been removed to avoid writing of unnecessary dummy 
zeros.
   The optional code for TRANSPuter systems has been removed 
as well as that for the HORIZONTal version (which is outdated by 
the CURVED version) to simplify the program structure.
   An error in the calculation of CHISUM in case of em-primaries
(erroneously the augmentation had been performed twice) has been 
eliminated.
   The interaction test has been extended to photonuclear reactions,
starting with a primary gamma either multi-hadron production 
(NDIFF = 1), vector meson production (NDIFF = 2) or a mixture 
(NDIFF = 0) according natural occurrence may be chosen.
   Constants for mass, decay time etc. have been checked and updated 
according with the most recent Particle Data Booklet (Jul. 2000).
   The content of the .dbase file has been extended and modified
to meet the requirements of the Auger project simulations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.90                       (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, NEXUS-01
(not released, Aug. 1999)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET98, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The new NEXUS interaction model has been coupled with CORSIKA. This 
needs a new I/O file (Unit NEXPRM = 97) which is used to transfer the 
NEXUS parameters from the DATAC input to the NEXUS package. The CMZ
options to get the NEXUS links are named NEXUS and NEXUSSIG.
Changements for this options are necessary in BOX2, DATAC, INPRM, SDPM, 
START. A combination of NEXUS with QGSJETSIG and QGSJET with NEXUSSIG 
is not possible because of many identical subroutine names used in both 
source codes.
   To simulate showers down to 1000 m below sea level some
inconsistencies have been removed in BLOCK1, BOX2, INPRM, EGSINI.
   A complete revision of the EGS4 portion has been made to overcome
problems in connection with single precision. The interpolation of
trigonometric functions from a table has been replaced by ordinary 
trigonometric functions. Also the approximation of exponentials and 
logarithms by the first members of a power expansion has been 
modified to adapt to the enhanced precision. Both means elongate the
computing time by about 30 %. As the source code of the CORSIKA-EGS4 
originates from 1986, relevant error corrections available with the 
1998 version of EGS4 have been taken over. Affected routines are 
BHABHA/MOLLER and PAIR/MUPAIR. Additionally debugging statements (to
be activated by keyword EGSDEB) and many comments have been inserted 
into all EGS routines for easier reading and understanding. Only the 
quantities related with the cross section file to be read in are still 
used as single precision variables. The meaning of the quantities
GBRii (Gamma Branching Ratios) has been interchanged to get better
precision for processes with low probability, such as mu+mu- pair
formation. Consequently new EGSDAT sets are necessary now named
EGSDAT3...; they are not compatible with the EGSDAT2.. sets.
Moreover an error (use of electron Compton wavelength instead of
muon Compton wavelength) within the screening functions of the form 
factor for mu+mu- pair formation has been corrected leading to an 
onset of this process now at about 1.4 TeV (compared with about 7 GeV 
in the old version).
   Photonuclear reactions have been revised, now taking into account
the diffractive interaction of the photon leading to rho and omega 
vector mesons. By this reaction type the photon energy is transferred 
essentially to 2 pions which results in a harder muon spectrum (in 
contrast with the multi-pion production). This might be of importance 
for neutrino experiments for detection of muons induced by TeV 
gamma rays coming from point sources. This extension implies new 
routines RHOGEN and RHO0DC and changements in PIGEN and RESDEC. 
   To control the energy balance and energy deposit within a shower 
additional information on the longitudinal distribution of various
energies (of gammas, electrons, muons, hadrons,...) and energy 
deposits are now formed and printed out. This revealed many 
changements all over the program in routines AAMAIN, BOX3, DECAY1, 
EM, ETADEC, KDECAY, MUBREM, MUDECY, MUPRPR, MUTRAC, NUCINT, OUTPUT, 
PI0DEC, SDPM, TSTACK, UPDATE, EGS4, MPPROP, PIGEN1, PIGEN2, ELECTR, 
PHOTO, PHOTON, CGHEI, BOX60, BOX65, BOX70, HMESON, ISOBAR, NIHILA, 
SINGLE, VHMESO, DPMJST, HDPM, QGSTOR, SIBLK2, SIBSTR, VSTORE to get 
the ionization energy loss and the energy of cut particles into 
this distributions. Within the particle longitudinal array the 
columns of mu+ and mu- have been interchanged (to have the same 
sequence as in the particle code).
   In the muon transport the multiple scattering is now done at
half of the penetrated matter instead half of the track length.
Also for muon energies below 65 GeV the transport step is reduced
to improve the arrival time calculation. (Before muons with 
E ~ 400 MeV arrived too late by max 60 nsec.) Routine UPDATE has 
been revised, so that now the angular range may be extented to 
70 deg. The improvement results also in a better timing information. 
To the additional muon information the generation counter is added 
in a similar way as for ordinary particles. For muons originating 
from pion decay the generation counter is augmented by 50. 
Therefore by the additional muon information it is possible to 
distinguish between muons coming form K-decays and those coming from 
pion decays.
   Nucleus-air cross-sections for QGSJET are now kept
in the data file SECTNU to be calculated together 
with the QGSDATA00 file (rsp. QGSDATAR, not compatible with former 
QGSDATA files). They have been changed by a few percent. 
The revised QGSJET code is named QGSJET00.f. 
   New CMZ options BYTERECL (in combination with DECUNIX), VOLUMEDET,
and VOLUMECORR have been introduced. As in some unix compilers 
(IBM RS/6000, HP) the RECL parameter in needed in bytes (default is 
4-byte words), by the CMZ option BYTERECL this parameter is set 
correspondingly. The options VOLUMEDET and VOLUMECORR influence the 
angular dependence of the primary's zenith angle distribution in
a manner as needed for volume detectors (sphere rsp. long vertical
string). The default corresponds with an angular dependence as needed 
for flat horizontal detectors.
   The routines of the ISOBAR model have been eliminated, as they
are no longer adequate to the raised requirements of shower 
simulation. All corresponding variables have been erased, a link 
with GHEISHA is now necessary in any case.
   A new option called CURVED is available which permits to overcome 
the problems of the former HORIZONT option. CURVED uses a piecewise 
planar atmosphere and is capable to simulate showers as flat as 
89 deg (for Cherenkov only 88 deg) of zenith angle.
The introduction of this option needed a lot of changements within
AAMAIN, BOX2, BOX3, DATAC, EM, INPRM, MUBREM, MUDECY, MUPRPR, MUTRAC, 
NUCINT, OUTPUT, UPDATE, RESDEC, EGSINI, EGS4, ELECTR, HOWFAR, MPPROP, 
PHOTON, PIGEN, PIGEN1, PIGEN2, UPHI, and new routines CORINC, CORNEC, 
NRANGC, PRANGC, THICKC, UPDATC.  For Cherenkov with CURVED the 
two new functions DISTIP and TOFIP respect the optical
ray bending by varying refractive index within the atmosphere. 
The index tables are initialized by the new routine INRTAB.
   A new keyword PAROUT has been introduced. By the flag FPAROUT 
the particle output might be disabled, by the flag FTABOUT a table 
output might be enabled; this table writes essential features of the 
charged particles of a shower event onto unit 46 with the filename 
suffix .tab.
   6 South pole atmospheres are now available by the keyword setting 
'ATMOD' to  11 ... 16 corresponding to  4 seasons and two different 
models (MSIS-90-E model and Lipari model).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.800:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(not released  Aug 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To get rid of the fixed layer boundaries at 4, 10, 40, and 100 km of 
the atmosphere, they may be now read in together with the atmospheric
parameters using the keyword ATMLAY. 
   The fixed cut (3 MeV) for electrons in the calculation of muonic
bremsstrahlung and pair formation is replaced by the actual cut of
electrons.
   The unnecessary copying of vertex coordinates in many routines has
been eliminated. Copying is now performed only in NUCINT, PIGEN, EM, 
RESDEC, MUDECAY, MUBREM, MUPRPR, Nevertheless coordinates CURPAR(2)...
..CURPAR(4) have to be copied for spectators in all interaction models 
treating primary nuclei.
   The cross-section and target of first interaction are now printed 
out together with the other parameters of first interaction.
   As some compilers need an EXTERNAL statement for correct linking of
data initialization routines BLOCK DATA ..., such EXTERNAL statements
have been added to AAMAIN.
   To avoid warnings produced by sensitive compilers many declared but
unused variables have been eliminated. Also expressions using a 
negative sign heading a variable have been modified by brackets.
   New subroutines for format-free reading of input replace the lengthy
routines DATAC and LOWUP.
   A set of routines to read in external atmospheres and to include 
more precise calculation of Cherenkov photons may be used for Cherenkov 
telescopes. They include subroutines written in C by K. Bernloehr for 
the HEGRA telescopes to be linked with CORSIKA. These new options are 
available by the CMZ selection words ATMEXT, IACT. The former separate
Cherenkov routines CERENE and CERENH are now replaced by CERENK with
CERLDE and CERLDH.
========================================================================

Version 5.644:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
( April 17, 2000)               SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)
(only for internal use)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Printout of particle number longitudinal development on extra
blocks of the DATxxxxxx file (before the EVTE block; first word
of those blocks contains 'LONG'.)
   Improved muon tracking by shorter step length according with
its energy.
   Hadronic generation counter is incremented by 50 for muons 
originating from charged pion decay.
========================================================================
   Error corrected in Jan 4, 2000; Jan 17, 00; Apr 5, 00; Sept 4, 00
-   'Millennium' problem in .dbase file eliminated.
-   Parametrization of pair and brems-cross-sections for muons
    above 10^5 GeV corrected.
-   LPCT1 must be set for em primaries.
-   Coupling SIBYLL 1.6 with CORSIKA improved for energies above 
    10^16 eV to avoid numerical problems with single precision 
    representation of the SIBYLL particle momenta.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Error corrected in Dec 1, 1998:
A bug in QGSJET producing charmed mesons is detected.  It occurs only 
with primary nuclei predominantly at energies above 10^15 eV.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Error correction in Oct 13, 1998:
An error within dpmjet2.f has been correct to select the dataset BSITE 
appropriate with the projectile and target of each collision.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.624:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released August 11, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A bug in subroutine MUPAIR has been eliminated. (The weight for
subtracting the NKG was not set.) This error became efficiently only
with the THIN option when giving keywords EGS and NKG in parallel and 
resulted sometimes (after the rare events of mu+mu- pair formation)
in an enhanced NKG output.
   The numbering of some constants used in muon bremsstrahlung has been 
corrected in START.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.623:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released June 09, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The step length factor for multiple scattering of em particles is
now set to 1 as default with the CERENKOV option and with the thin 
option, with other options the default value is 10 as before.
   Some irregularities in the energy-elasticity matrix when using EGS
have been eliminated (undefined EKINL).
   A bug in subroutine BOX2 calculating the cross sections for muon 
pair production cross sections at ultrahigh energies has been 
eliminated (FRACTN must read FRAPTN, FRACTNO must read FRPTNO).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.621:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Apr. 20, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   An inconsistency in the initialization of the thickness at the
layer boundaries has been eliminated. (Atmospheres different 
from the standard atmosphere did not become effective).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.620:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Apr.  3, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To prevent a longitudinal fit to be tried to negative electron
numbers the minimal value of the electron numbers is set to zero.
   In case that EGS and NKG are activated the contribution of
gammas producing photonuclear reactions or muon pairs must be 
subtracted from NKG. The subtracted fraction is calculated more 
precisely taking into account the exact origin of this photon.
   To facilitate the extraction of various options for shower
simulation and interaction tests, the makefiles 'makeall' and
'makeint' have been installed.
   Within the 3-body kinematics of PIGEN2 the occurrence of sqrt with 
negative arguments is prohibited. The printout of the primary energy 
in case of selection from spectrum is now performed.
   In QGSJET a bug has been removed, which in case of nuclear primaries
nearly doubled the shower energy.
   An error resulting eventually in a negative sqrt has been eliminated 
in UPDATE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.611:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Mar. 17, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A serious error in the initialization of some constants used for muon 
multiple scattering according to Moliere's theory has been eliminated.
A considerable enlarging of the muon lateral distribution by about
15 % results from this error.
The error was introduced with version 5203, therefore all results
obtained with versions between 5203 and 5610 should be examined
carefully before use. In doubtful cases the simulations should be 
rerun.  
   The call for ATMIN in subroutine START was misplaced and is now
interchanged with the thickness calculation at lower boundaries.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.610:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Mar. 09, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The fit function of the longitudinal development has been modified
from Ball's function to Hillas' function, which gives less fits
with extreme chi**2. For small chi**2 the two fits coincide.
   The elasticity in case of nuclear projectiles is now calculated
for all models as the energy ratio of the most energetic secondary  
to the primary energy/nucleon.
  Many print formats have been adapted to avoid overflows also for
the highest energy showers 5*10**20 eV.
   To save computing time with the EGS specification it is important
to take an EGSDATA file which fits best to your specified lower
boundary of the em particles. (Specifying cuts at 3 MeV and employing 
an EGSDAT2 data set ranging down to 50 keV needs up to 6 times more
computing time compared with a data set ranging down only to 3 MeV!)
Therefore we offer now 5 EGSDAT2 data sets marked with a suffix which 
gives the lowest kinetic energy (in MeV). Within subroutine EGSINI an 
automatic selection of the optimal data set is made and the appropriate 
data set read in.
   The default hadronic cross sections have been modified as well as 
radiation length and critical energy for NKG calculations (see 
footnotes p. 52 and p. 65 in FZKA-6019).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.604:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Feb. 16, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Serious errors occurring at electron and gamma energies above 10**17
eV have been detected within BREMSLPM and LPMEFFECT and are now 
eliminated. To get the new version of routine PRTIME for DECUNIX 
computers which overcomes the year 2000 you should select the 
'NEWDATE' option.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.603:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Feb. 04, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Within HDPM (subroutine PARNUM) an error has been eliminated.
In connection with the new dataset EGSDAT2 ranging down to 50 keV
at high energy electrons and gammas (> 10**14 eV) rounding errors
caused a division by 0 within subroutine MOLLER. As consequence many
variables within EGS have been declared to double precision.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.602:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Jan. 28, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  An error within BREMSLPM has been corrected. This error was only
effective in the THIN option and affected the treatment of particles
in the LPM energy range.
  An error in PRANGE has been corrected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.601:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
(released Jan. 15, 1998)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A bug in subroutine TSTEND which is effective only with the THIN
option and concerns the array RESRAN has been fixed.
  Initialization of RESTMS has been moved from PAMAF to BLOCK1.
  In connection with CERENKOV a bug in UPDATE has been detected and
fixed. Also the energy cuts of hadrons emerging from photonuclear
reactions have been verified.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.600:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(released Dec. 19, 1997)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A revision of the DPMJET routines including the coupling routines
together with its author J. Ranft was necessary to get them run in
a manner consistent with the stand alone version of DPMJET. The most 
recent version DPMJET2.4 is now coupled. This implied many 
modifications of the DPMJET coupling routines. Our coupling is prepared 
to contain also the evaporation module of A. Ferrari and P.R. Sala, 
but we are not allowed to distribute this module.
   The routine PRTIME giving date and time for DECUNIX computers has 
been modified to overcome the year 2000 without problems. To get
the old date routine, you should select 'OFFIC'.
   To study the influence of meteorological effects within the
atmosphere we have now built in (besides the US standard atmosphere)
7 atmospheric parameter sets based on measured data of the Deutsche
Wetter Dienst (German meteorological service) measured above Stuttgart.
They represent essentially the seasonal variations of the atmospheric
depth distribution. The various sets may be chosen by the keyword
ATMOD. To be independent from the situation of Central Europe, it is
possible to read in sets of atmospheric parameters suitable for the
regarded location. These changements affected the routines BLOCK1,
DATAC, STAEND, and START.
   Some small errors have been eliminated. They occurred only if
primaries were penetrating down to the observation level and affected
PHISCT, VSCAT and BNORMC.
   A revision of the thinning algorithm caused by unpublished results
of C. Pryke revealed a large number of changements in the application
of thinning. Now all particles below ETHINN, which emerge from an
interaction, are exposed to the algorithm. Also the thinning algorithm 
is applied in the rare interactions of EGS4 (MUPAIR and PIGEN). These
changements result in a more efficient thinning, so less particles 
with low weight are followed which results in a drastic shortening of 
the computing times. A new table indicating the energy - weight 
statistics of all observed particles is added to the list output
in case of thinning. A bug within the energy - elasticity table,
occurring with the THIN option, is eliminated. Some arrays are 
redimensioned to adapt to the larger particle numbers at the
highest energies (QGSJET, internal stack).
   The suppression of debug output from GHEISHA is now possible and
selectable by the keyword GHEIDB.
   A bug in the subroutines ELECTR of the EGS part, which becomes 
efficient only with the PLOTSH option, has been eliminated.
   The file EGSDAT2 has been modified to come down with the energy
of electromagnetic particles as low as 50 keV.
   Using more than 1 observation level not given in correct sequence
in the input caused serious errors in the EGS portion. The bug is
now fixed and any sequence of the observation levels admitted.
   To improve the quality of CORSIKA at the highest energies, pi(0)'s
are now tracked and may undergo hadronic interactions. In the same way
eta's are treated. (Affected routines are BOX2, BOX3, NUCINT, SDPM,
and the link routines for the hadronic interaction models.) In EGS
the LPM-effect is respected by suppression of BREMS and PAIR events
depending on the energy of interacting particle and of the possible
product particle. The formalism of MOCCA/AIRES has been adapted.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.203:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(released October 10, 1997)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A bug in the subroutines ELECTR and PHOTON of the EGS part, which
becomes efficient only in the PLOTSH option, has been eliminated.
  For calculation of the number of scattering events of muon multiple
scattering erroneously weight percent have been adopted instead of 
atomic percent. Effects of this error are negligible, nevertheless 
the error in subroutine START is now corrected.
  Within the routine START the calls to the routines DATAC and
ATMIN (for HORIZONT option)  have been interchanged, to get the
height of the observation levels corrected for the HORIZONT option.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.202:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(released April 24, 1997)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To get compatibility with all kinds of computers, the maximum 
block size for the external stack EXST has to be limited to less than
32768. Consequently MAXSTK is now at 312 for the THIN option. 
   Also some of the formats are longer than 132 characters/line,
which is not tolerated for all computers. Therefore many formats have
changed to meet with this need.
  A bug has been fixed in QGSJET for realistic fragmentation.
  A bug has been fixed in DATAC for DATBAS input.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.201:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(released April 16, 1997)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Error corrections:
   Within BOX2 for VENUSSIG the charged pion cross sections are taken 
instead of the Kaon cross sections. For Kaons the call to VENSIG 
should read
          CALL VENSIG(ELAB,3)
   Within GHEISHA the arrays SNUM and BNUM have been extended to keep
also the strangeness and baryon numbers of Omega's.
   A discussion with K. Werner revealed, that the p-p cross section in
VENSIGINI should comprise also diffraction. The corrected values are
used only to calculated nucleus-air cross sections, which differ by 
2 to 3 % from the older ones (at energies above 10**15 eV).
   To enable the extraction of the system C-file for the LINUX option, 
the make-file has been modified slightly.
   A bug in subroutine FREBLK has been indicated by C. Trinchero and
removed.
   SIBYLL.f has been corrected for an error in subroutine PART_INT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.200:                     (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(released March 15, 1997)        SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To enable simulations up to the highest energies the so-called
'thinning' is introduced also into hadronic interactions and decays. 
It enables to drop the majority of particles emerging from a reaction  
and keeping only one with simultaneous enlarging its weight. This 
reduces the calculation times considerably, but may also reduce the 
correct fluctuations, therefore it should be used with precautions. 
Many changements had to be made, as now for each particle the weight 
must be considered and hence the output data structure has to be 
changed. The moving of particles from SECPAR to the stack has been 
modified. Now an intermediate stack is used to collect all particles 
from a reaction and select only one of them for thinning. This needs 
new routines TSTINI, TSTEND, TSTOUT (the former TSTACK), and a new 
TSTACK. This collection before writing needs a little bit computer 
time: about 6 % for HDPM, SIBYLL and QGS, about 2% for DPMJET and 
VENUS, if the electromagnetic component is not simulated. Also the
introduction of a new stack needs more than 2 MB memory additionally.
No special stack handling is needed for the EGS4 routines. The 
thinning is activated by the CMZ option THIN. 
   Some parametrizations of the muon cross sections had to be modified
to meet the extended energy range up to 10**20 eV.
   The initialization of EGS4 is now performed in the routine EGSINI. 
The cross section file for the EGS routines is extended up to 
10**20 eV, new name is EGSDAT2, size is 2621 lines. The dimensions 
of all arrays keeping the cross sections and branching ratios for 
EGS have been extended from 200 to 500.
   A new macro has been implemented into the cmz-file which comfortably 
permits to extract a FORTRAN file with the desired options watching 
that no conflicting options are selected simultaneously. To activate
it, you should give the command 'exec macro' when you have entered the 
cmz program.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.100: not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(internally used since Jan 97)      SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To enable simulations up to the highest energies the so-called
'thinning' is introduced into EGS4. By thinning one of the particles
emerging from an interaction is dropped immediately, while the other is 
kept with increased weight. This reduces the calculation times 
considerably, but may also reduce the correct fluctuations, therefore 
it should be used with precautions. Many changements had to be made, as 
now for each particle the weight must be considered and hence the output 
data structure has to be changed. The thinning option is activated 
by the CMZ option THIN.
   To enable the coupling of routines treating the em-particles at
energies above 10**16 eV by the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, some
changements have been made in routines EM, BOX3, and MUDECY. Connecting
routine to this extension will be routine LPM. The addition of a set
of LPM routines will be made in a later release.
   Considerable improvement of the muon tracking has been performed.
Muons are now no longer tracked by BOX3 but rather by subroutine 
MUTRAC. Muon bremsstrahlung and muon pair production are treated in
subroutines MUBREM and MUPRPR. The cross sections for these processes
are calculated in BOX2 by calling the functions GBRSGM and GPRSGM. 
The explicit treatment of these processes needs also modifications in
PRANGE and UPDATE concerning the energy loss of muons at high energies.
   These improvements take also into account a more frequent 
multiple scattering. The calculation of the scattering angle in 
UPDATE is extended by Moliere scattering (besides the existing Gauss
distribution for the scattering angle). The Moliere option is
activated by the code word MUMULT and setting the flag FMOLI. The
Moliere scattering angle is determined in subroutine MMOLIE, which
calls the routine MMOL4. If the path length is too short for 
application of Moliere's theory, plural Coulomb scattering 
events are considered in routine MUCOUL, which calls the routine MPOISS
for Poisson distribution. Initialization of some parameters for
Moliere's theory is performed in START.
   Some changements have been made in AAMAIN, OUTPUT, and BOX3 for 
keeping the information for the additional muon output option.
 Some minor changes have been performed: 
* Gathering of the isobar routines into the PATCH ISOBAR, gathering 
  the HDPM routines into the PATCH HDPM, gathering the NKG-routines 
  into the PATCH NKG.
* Tuning the transverse momentum distribution in the HDPM model to
  recent experimental findings (UA1/MIMI) by modifications in HDPM,
  PPARAM, and new subroutine PTRAM
* Enlarging the array for secondary particles of HDPM from 2000 to
  3000; this needs also an enlargement of the array for random 
  numbers by the same amount.
* In subroutine NKG the minimal distance between the subshower axis 
  and a point where the electron density is calculated, has been 
  limited to 1 cm (The old minimal distance of sqrt(10**-5) is 
  experimentally not reasonable).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.024: not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(Nov 1996)                          SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)
(used for shower calculations with individual cross sections)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To use the various hadronic interaction models with their own
cross sections for determining the free path up to the next hadronic 
interaction, the options VENUSSIG, QGSSIG, and DPMJETSIG  have been 
introduced to enable the various cross sections independently from the 
usage of the hadronic interaction  model, similar to the SIBYLLSIG 
option. Selecting more than one cross section option gives unpredictable 
results. From practical reasons the cross sections of nucleus-nucleus
collisions are calculated using the specific hadron-nucleus cross
sections of VENUSSIG, QGSSIG, or DPMJETSIG and taking the Glauber tables
already implemented in CORSIKA.
   Some smaller improvements have been performed within the DPMJET-2
package according to the suggestions of J. Ranft.
   The DPMJET-2 has been updated to get p_t distributions better in
accordance with experimental data.
  Corrections of smaller errors:
*  In subroutine PIGEN1 and PIGEN1 the calculation of the cm angle 3 
   is faulty; one should read: 
C ***  ABOVE 1300 MEV THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION IS DETERMINED
C ***  BY THE TRANSVERSE MOMENTUM OF THE PION
       PT=1.D3*PTRANS(DUMMY)                              <========
       COSTE3=SQRT(MAX(0.D0,P3CM**2-PT**2))/P3CM
      END IF
   and
C***  NOW SELECT THE THREE INDEPENDENT ANGLES IN C.M. SYSTEM
      PT3=1.D3*PTRANS(DUMMY)                              <========
      SIN3CM=MIN(1.,PT3/P3CM)                             <========
      COS3CM=SQRT(1.-SIN3CM**2)
      CALL RMMAR(RNNO86,1,2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.023: not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(July 1996)                          SIBYLL 1.6, QGSJET, and DPMJET-II)
(used to produce the results of the report FZKA-5828)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To compare the influence of interaction models, we have extended the
coupling also to DPMJET (Version II). The coupling routines are 
contained within patch DPMJETLINK, DPMJET is activated by the cmz select
option DPMJET. Selecting more than one interaction model at the same 
time suppresses DPMJET in favour of VENUS, SIBYLL, or QGS.
Many modifications within the interaction test routines have been made 
to treat the spectators and to check energy conservation.
   Additionally some changements have been made and small errors are 
eliminated:
*  To avoid the warnings given by some compilers, quantities declared
   at the beginning of BOX2, DATAC, KDECAY and MUDECY but only used in
   the horizontal rsp. neutrino option, are now activated only when 
   needed.
*  Modification in PAMAF: To get better agreement in the energy balance 
   of the interactions, we use now the masses of nuclei without binding 
   effects. 
*  BOX2: The treatment of strange baryons is adapted individually to the
   interaction program. The treatment of sigma(0) and anti-sigma(0)
   by GHEISHA is definitely excluded now by setting FDECAY=.true..
*  To increase the angular precision of the EGS-routines, the dimension
   of the arrays SIN0 and SIN1 is increased from 1002 to 20002, also the
   value of MXSINC accordingly.
*  The energy border between high and low energy interaction model
   is selectable in the interactiontest. Two variables HILOELB and
   HILOECM are used to steer the border.
*  Additional check in INPRM for selection of longitudinal sampling
   in the case of the horizontal shower option, when the atmosphere
   becomes thicker than 1040 g/cm**2.
*  The fraction of charge exchange within PIGEN1 has been made
   consistent with RESDEC, which is based on theoretical considerations.
New cmz-options have been added. Now an option to generate a program
version running on PC's under LINUX is available. The PLOTSH option
causes the write out of start and endpoints of all particle tracks, 
separately for hadrons, muons, and electromagnetic particles. A special 
program makes the shower development visible on screen or on plots. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.012: not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5, 
(Jan 1996)                          SIBYLL 1.6 and QGSJET)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Considerable extensions have been made by coupling with the high 
energy interaction programs SIBYLL and QGSJET.  The coupling is done via 
routines contained within the patches SIBYLLINK and QGSLINK. These
couplings are activated by the cmz select options SIBYLL and QGS rsp.
Selecting more than one high energy interaction model simultaneously
is blocked by suppression of SIBYLL and QGS if VENUS is selected,
and by suppressing QGS if SIBYLL is selected. For all these models
the low energy interaction routines of GHEISHA are coupled. Transition
energy is for all cases 80 GeV (Elab). In all models their use
is activated by default and may be deactivated using a data card
with the key words VENUS, SIBYLL, and QGSJET.
  As addition and independent from this model selection the
QCD-calculated cross sections of the SIBYLL model can be selected using
the cmz selection option SIBYLLSIG. Their use is then activated by 
default and may be deactivated using a data card with the key word 
SIBSIG. 
   The decay of pi(0) into e(+)+e(-)+gamma has been added to the 
PI0DEC routine. This requested also changes within DECAY6, MPPROP,
and SHOWER. (Now all pi(0)'s decay within PI0DEC, while PIZERO of the
EGS patch is no longer in use.)
   A new possibility of fragmentation (activated by NFRAGM = 4) is
introduced, which gives realistic nucleus fragments according to the 
used model, but without transverse momentum. (Changements within VAPOR 
and START).
   Some inconsistencies and small errors have been removed:
*  DATAB (and if necessary DATAB2) are now reset to 0 at begin of 
   simulation (changement in START).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.603: not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5)
(for internal use since JAN 18, 1996)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Within the routines HDPM, LEADDF, and LEDENY the calculation of the
rapidity was modified to formulas which show better numerical stability 
at very high energy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.60 : not released        (coupled with VENUS4.12/5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The key word DATBAS is used to enable a new option which writes a run
summary to the output unit 45. This output is intended as input to a 
data base administrating a shower library. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.502: from DEC 12, 1995   (coupled with VENUS4.12/5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Some inconsistencies and small errors have been removed:
*  Bug in PRANGE fixed (occurred, if first interaction above 100km)
*  Bug in AMOEBA (Dimension Y(MP) instead of Y(NP)); the effect 
   depends on the compiler.
*  In DECAY6 by chance COSFI4 could be >1 by rounding errors. Now
   its value is limited.
*  Some inconsistencies in using the interactiontest have been removed
   (ELCUT no longer active in interactiontest, target selection in
   SDPM for VENUS tests, target settings for arbitrary targets and
   settings of  diffractive probabilities in VENLNK )
*  An inconsistency in the monitor printout (for em-particles 
   with Ekin > ECTMAP the level of the last hadronic interaction was
   not printed) has been removed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.501: from NOV 07, 1995   (coupled with VENUS4.12/5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Some small errors have been eliminated. They refer to:
*  a typing error in INPRM (statement was beginning before column 7), 
*  check of the limit of ELCUT(1) in the GHEISHA option (subroutine
   INPRM),
*  the redefinition of XCER and YCER in the subroutines CERENE and 
   CERENH,
*  definition of CGHSIG as DOUBLE PRECISION at beginning of subroutine
   BOX2 (instead of REAL)
*  the limitation of GAM0 to values above 1.0001 (subroutines PRANGE 
   and UPDATE).
*  the fit at the average longitudinal distribution (the fit was made 
   to PLONG instead of APLONG), 
*  the position of the CLOSE statements at the end of AAMAIN, 
*  the routine HISOUT forming the dsname for the HISTDS output file, 
*  a wrong format statement label used in many WRITE statements in
   subroutine GETBUS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.50 : from OCT 06, 1995   (coupled with VENUS4.12/5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A significant improvement of the range of all particles, which 
suffer from ionization energy loss before decay, has been made in BOX2, 
implementing the new subroutine PRANGE.  The range's error is now 
less than 0.6 % also in unfavorable cases, e.g. muons with energy 
of 3.7 GeV starting in 30 km altitude at 45 degrees, which penetrate 
down to sea level. As this new approach is only possible for an 
exponential atmosphere, it can not be applied in combination with 
the horizontal shower option, which still uses the range calculation 
of version 4.114.
   The new formulas for the ionization and pair formation energy loss 
are now also used in subroutine UPDATE for all charged particles to
calculate the gamma factor at the end of the flight path.
   The variable THICKH has been added to COMMON PARPAR, a new COMMON 
ATMOS2 has been introduced to keep the layer boundary altitudes and 
their thicknesses.
   An inconsistency (the altitude H in COMMON PARPAR was not set
correctly) in the call of UPDATE from the MAIN has been eliminated
in the case, the primary penetrates through down to the lowest 
observation level.
   Instead of 1 Cherenkov array now up to 20 Cherenkov arrays are
considered, which are (with respect to the origin) scattered at random 
within a predefined area. Keyword is CSCAT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.468: from SEPT 29, 1995            (coupled with VENUS4.12/5,
                                                          not released)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Using FIXHEI to fix the height of the first interaction, in the case
of decaying particles (pions, kaons, str. baryons) the first action 
of those particles is no longer determined by BOX2, but rather will be 
always an interaction and not a decay.
   With the new keyword FIXCHI the starting altitude of the primary is 
shifted from the top of the atmosphere to the value of CHI0 
(in g/cm**2), which serves to study the development of subshowers.
   Changements in subroutine NUCINT to treat deuterons, tritons and
alpha particles by GHEISHA, if selected and if the energy is in the 
correct range.
   When entering EGS, the energy of EM-particles is checked to fall 
below the upper limit (at present 10**7 GeV) of the EGSDATA set. The
calculation of the EM-rejection boundary is moved into the main program.
  In the Cherenkov case now the EGS-flag FEGS is set in START; the
FEGS condition is still checked in subroutine EM also in the Cherenkov
case (as it was in the versions before 4.11).
   The bunch size is printed now, and when calculated in GETBUS it 
is printed always after the GETBUS call.
   All the printing statements for the interaction models have now been
collected from INPRM into START, while the check of shower parameters
and their printing is taken from START into INPRM. 
   The routine DATAC has been modified to accept format free input data,
including lower case characters, which are converted within the new
subroutine LOWUP.
   A check of the lateral distribution of Cherenkov photons produced by
low energy gammas (20 GeV to 1 TeV) shows, that the mean free path
between two multiple scattering events should be reduced in critical
cases on the expenses of longer computing time. During the check the
routine CERENE has been modified to take into account the continuous
energy loss EDEP along the step considered in CERENE, which becomes 
essential for low energy electrons just above the Cherenkov threshold.
New keywords STEPFC (giving the step size prolongation factor for
electron multiple scattering in EGS) and CWAVLG (to specify the
Cherenkov wave length band) have been built in.
   The random distribution for the zenith angles has been modified to
get an intensity proportional to  sin(theta)*cos(theta), where the
sin(theta) comes from the solid angle element and the cos(theta) comes 
from the horizontal area of the measuring array. (The older versions 
neglected the cos(theta) dependence, which is only correct for spherical
detectors.)
   Some small errors have been eliminated: 
* Typing error in KDECAY (Neutrino Version COSTCM instead of COSCM); 
* OPEN of files also for VMS in INPRM; 
* Calculation of the elasticity matrix table corrected 
  (MAIN, HDPM, CGHEI, VSTORE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.114: from SEPT 11, 1995 (not released)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Erroneously in the calculation of the range to decay for neutral 
kaons and neutral strange baryons an ionization energy loss was 
accounted for.  This mistake in BOX2 is now eliminated.
   The printout of the random generator status and the event number at 
VENUS error messages or error stops is improved in VENINI and VENLNK.
    A revised version of the subroutine CERENE has been built in to
improve the Cherenkov intensities at low energy photon induced showers.
    Correction of an error in CHISQ by demanding positive width.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.113: from JUNE 23, 1995  (withdrawn August 23, 1995 because of
                                    problems with VENUS 5.01/6)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The sequence of the columns header of the longitudinal distribution
was not correct and has been changed to give the correct sequence of the
columns beginning with 'gammas, POSITRONS, ELECTRONS, mu-, mu+, ...'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.112: from JUNE 19, 1995  (withdrawn August 23, 1995 because of
                                    problems with VENUS 5.01/6)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Eliminating bugs from Subroutine BOX2: Errors in COR2 and DH. 
The quantity PLAB was not set for the use in GHEISHA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.11 : from MAY 19, 1995   (withdrawn August 23, 1995 because of
                                    problems with VENUS 5.01/6)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Including of subroutine VAPOR for treatment of fragmentation in
realistic manner, regarding transverse momentum for the fragments.
  The VENUS version 5.01 is now coupled with CORSIKA.
  All strange baryons with s = +-2 and +-3 are now generated by VENUS
and tracked explicitly, low energy treatment is done by GHEISHA. As 
their treatment by the isobar-model is not possible, a selection of 
VENUS needs also an automatic selection of GHEISHA. Kaon and gamma 
induced interactions are now also treated by VENUS, if energy is high 
enough. 
   The longitudinal profiles of various particle species are now 
calculated if corresponding flag LLONGI is set. A fit is made for the 
longitudinal distribution of the 'all charged particles' and the fit 
parameters are written to the EVTE block., if the fit flag FLGFIT is 
set. New subroutines are AMOEBA, CHISQ, LONGFT.
   Cherenkov routines are modified to enable the photon registration in 
an array with selectable detector number NCERX, NCERY, grid spacing
DCERX, DCERY, and detector size ACERX, ACERY. The orientation of the 
array relative to magnetic north may be chosen by ARRANG, the angle 
between the array x-axis and north. The Cherenkov output may now be
directed to the Cherenkov output (LCERFI=.true.) or to the particle 
output (LCERFI=.false.). An error in the FORMAT-statement (label 100) 
of subroutine GETBUS is corrected.
   The refractive index of air in the routines CERENE and CERENH is
calculated in a more precise way. This affects the emission angle 
and also the arrival time of the Cherenkov photon bunches. The velocity 
of the Cherenkov emitting electrons is now considered.
This eliminates the uncertainty of the older calculation of the arrival
time, which is in the order < 1 nsec. The arrival time of the Cherenkov
photons is no longer given relative to the arrival of the shower axis,
but - in consistency with the other particles - relative to the first 
interaction.
   The option names CERENK and INTTST are changed to CERENKOV and 
INTTEST, the new option VMS for running on VAX or DEC-AXP under VMS 
is added. A new option to select the target nucleus of the first 
interaction is added to the keyword FIXHEI. The variable N1STTR may 
have the values 0 = random target, 1 = nitrogen, 2 = oxygen, 3 = argon.
   The EQUIVALENCE of the nuclear cross sections PN30 ... PA60
with PNOA.... and the collision probabilities SEQU14...SEQU40 with 
SE14...  SE40 has been eliminated.
   NKG-routines AVAGE and MITAGE improved to calculate mean and 
deviation in a consistent manner.
   Selecting simultaneously EGS and NKG gave a too high value for 
the number of electrons for NKG. The effect was most pronounced in 
gamma-initiated showers and came from em-subshowers, originating 
from pi(0) after gamma-induced hadronic interactions. Now the 
contribution to NKG from gammas, producing muon pairs or hadrons 
(subroutines MUPAIR, PIGEN) is subtracted from the NKG output by 
calling NKG with negative argument. This implies changes in AVAGE, 
MITAGE, NKG, MUPAIR, PIGEN.
   All input parameters which are selected by the routine DATAC are 
checked in INPRM, whether they are in the range for which CORSIKA is 
designed for a proper use. If a parameter is outside of this range of 
confidence, the program will issue a warning and correct the parameter 
or stop. 
   By the VENPAR data card VENUS parameters may be changed relative to
the standard setting of subroutine VENINI.
   The generator for normal distributed random numbers RANNOR is
replaced by a new version which avoids trigonometric functions and 
therefore is a little bit faster.
   A new option MUADDI is available which causes by setting the flag
FMUADD the program to write additional information on the origin of 
the muons onto the particle tape just preceding the muon particle. 
The information corresponds with the particles' properties, but 
instead the time since first interaction, the altitude of origin is 
written. The particle codes for these additional information are 75 
and 76 for positive and negative muons.
   The calculation of the range of decaying particles (muons, charged
pions, kaons, and strange baryons), which is done in subroutine BOX2
has been improved by considering the slowing down during the flight
path. But the new range calculation is still not quite satisfactory, 
so we will try to improve it further in next future. 
Also the ionization loss in the tracking of the charged particles 
(subroutine UPDATE) is not sufficient, especially at lower energies, 
and will be improved in future.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.068: from October, 1994

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging of VENUS is improved by the keyword VENDBG, which enables to
set the amount of debug printout for VENUS. CERSIZ is now correctly
taken from input data card or computed internally by GETBUS, 
if set to 0. in the data card. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.065: from July, 1994

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The passage of the primary particle through the observation levels was
not watched and is now added to MAIN-program. 
The cut for low energy EM-particles, which have very small chance to 
produce measurable particles at the observation levels, is now 
calculated for each individual shower.
The cross section of pions in VENLNK is now calculated more consistent.
In VENLNK there was an error (LAPROJ was not set to -1),
which causes the internal use of a proton instead of a pion as the
leading particle of a pion-induced VENUS-collision. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.06 : from March, 1994

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORSIKA is now available as DECUNIX and MACintosh version with 
the corresponding HISTORIAN flags. The DECUNIX version runs on
DEC-stations under ULTRIX and ALPHAs under OSF/Unix, the MAC 
version runs under SYSTEM 7 with the ABSOFT Fortran 77.

The HISTORIAN flag INTTST selects now the code for a detailed
interaction test. The additional routines are 
  TSTINT   common deck for interaction test
  TST      block data for testing
  HISINI   initialization of histograms
  HISRES   reset histograms
  HISPRP   prepare histograming
  HISTRA   transform to a convenient reference system
  HISFIL   fill histograms 
  HISOUT   store histograms
For this interaction test HBOOK and ZEBRA from the CERN lib
has to be linked to the program.
The implementation of the interaction tests entailed a number of
minor changes in several CORSIKA routines.

GHEISHA interaction routines have been implemented for treatment of the
low energy hadronic interaction (selectable by the data card GHEISH  T).
If GHEISHA is selected as well the interaction cross sections are used
as parametrized in the GHEISHA code.
This improves the simulation of low energy interactions compared to the
crude treatment with the isobar model routines.
The time consumption goes up, however, by roughly a factor 2.
New routines necessary for running GHEISHA :
  UCOPY    copy of the CERN routine with the same name 
  VZERO    copy of the CERN routine with the same name
  FLPSOR   copy of the CERN routine with the same name
  GRANOR   random number generator adapted to the one used in CORSIKA
  GRNDM    random number generator adapted to the one used in CORSIKA
  GARNDM   random number generator adapted to the one used in CORSIKA
  CGCOMP   common deck
  CGHINI   initialization of GHEISHA
  CGHSIG   cross section calculation of GHEISHA
  CGHEI    interface to interaction routines 
All the above routines are appending at the end of CORSIKA.
The original GHEISHA routines, that are used together with CORSIKA
are in a separate file with about 16100 lines.

For high energy collisions the program VENUS for
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been implemented.
VENUS improves especially the nucleus-nucleus collision 
simulation at highest energies.  It increases the computing time
however by a factor of 15!!. The interface routines are
activated by the HISTORIAN flag VENUS. New routines for VENUS are
  VENUS    common deck
  VENINI   initialization of VENUS
  VENLNK   interface to interaction routines
  UTQSEA   structure function due to sea quarks
  UTQVAL   structure function due to valence quarks
  VSTORE   stores secondaries on stack
  RANGEN   random number generator adapted to the one used in CORSIKA
  VENDAT   block data for VENUS
These routines are appending the CORSIKA code, whereas the interaction
routine are in a separate file of about 17700 lines length. 
  VENDATA  external dataset with numerical values of structure
           function integrals. To be read at initialization time.

In routine AVAGE and MITAGE the printout of the NKG results
(looking like the union jack) gave the electron densities in
particles/Rmol**2. Now it is changed to particles/m**2 as it was
(and is) in the output on tape.

In BOX2 the cross sections are calculated by GHEISHA if the GHEISH
data card is set TRUE.

The muon decay code in BOX3 is now extracted to the new routine
MUDECY. BOX3 was changed consequently.

Now the last secondaries created in an interaction are always
written to the stack. Before the last one was kept as the new
current particle in the routines BOX60, BOX61, ... BOX74, HMESON,
VHMESON, SINGLE, ISOBAR, NIHILA, NUCINT. The return codes in these
routines have been removed.

The philosophy of energy and angular cutting has been changed.
Before a particle that was below the energy cut was still tracked and
stored on the stack if there was the chance to create in a decay
or interaction other particles that might be above their cuts.
Thus it could happen that hadrons were tracked down to zero energy
when the electron cut was at 3 MeV.
For angular cuts such a future vision was not applied.
Now rigorously all particles below some cuts are discarded before
being written to the stack. It is now in the responsibility of the 
user to take care that the cuts for the different particles are 
chosen reasonably. 

All ENTRY statements (AUSGB2, TSTACK, FSTACK, OUTEND, OUTEND2,
STAEND, INPRM, TOBUFC) have been converted to separate routines,
to be able to use a special programming tool for program
development here in Karlsruhe.

The tracking routine UPDATE has been improved and streamlined.
The new array SIGN in common PAM gives the charges of all particles.
It is filled in routine PAMAF.

The array declarations in RMMAQ, RMMAR, TOBUF were changed to get 
the program running even with explicit checking of array boundaries.

The limit between low and high energy interaction model is shifted 
to Elab = 80 GeV.

The standard energy cuts were changed to 0.3, 0.3, 0.003 and 
0.003 GeV for hadrons, muons, electrons and photons, respectively.

Some commons had to be rearranged to meet the requirements of 
standard Fortran 77.

The descriptions of the commons has been updated.

Minor changes in several routines due to the implementation of
VENUS, GHEISHA and the interaction test routines.

The postal code of Karlsruhe changed. Please regard the new
address in the header of the CORSIKA source in case you want to
send us paper mail.

Since beginning of 1994 we develop and run CORSIKA on DEC Alpha
stations. Therefore, and because of several other groups do not have
access to HISTORIAN we maintain CORSIKA now with the the help of the
CERN software CMZ (Code Management with Zebra). This package is
available from CERN for free and is probably used already by most of
the labs being involved in particle physics.
Now everybody is able to create the desired version of CORSIKA on his
own. 

There exists an updated version of the CORSIKA users guide, where the 
structure and the handling of the CMZ source is described. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.01 : from May 28, 1993

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DPHI in routine ADDANI was not properly defined.
The new angle phi at the end of the routine is stored in the
the variable DPH instead of the variable DPHI which is the 
subroutine argument. 
In case of CERENK and TRANSP code the statement number 447
appeared twice in the MAIN program.
Directly before the open of the Cherenkov tape the do loop
statement number has to be changed to 449.
In routine HDPM where the width of the gaussians for neutral
particles WIDN2 is calculated in the statement
      WIDN2 = MAX(1.D0 , 1.12275D0 - 0.0208D0 * RSLOG) * WIDC2
the MAX function has to be replaced by the MIN function to get 
correctly
      WIDN2 = MIN(1.D0 , 1.12275D0 - 0.0208D0 * RSLOG) * WIDC2

In routine SDPM directly before the loops 200 and 210 respectively,
the code should be included inside the IF blocks
C  CALCULATE GAMMA, BETA AND ENERGY IN CENTER OF MASS
          GCM = SQRT ( GAMMA * 0.5D0 + 0.5D0 ) 
          ECM = PAMA(ITYPE) * GCM * 2.D0 
          BETACM = SQRT ( 1.D0 - 1.D0 / GCM**2 )

In addition in SDPM the second loop over the HDPM calls (for protons;
statement number 210) should read
      DO 210 LL=1,NPRPRO 
instead of
      DO 210 LL=1,NNEPRO

In the routine AVAGE the write statements for the NKG-output for
each shower were activated only if the logical variable LPRINT is
true (in analogy to all the other printouts in the MAIN program).

The NKG routine uses now the energy cut for electrons that is specified
in ELCUT(3) and allows thus to account for detection thresholds.
The NKG electron number and the lateral distributions
are now depending on this cut.

The neutrinos are treated now explicitly when choosing the HISTORIAN
flag NEUTRINO. ...

The flag INTTST allows to create histograms about many quantities
of the interaction model. This version requires then HBOOK from 
the CERN library.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.00 : from April 22, 1993

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Since Version 3.05 many changes in subroutines and common blocks 
have been made and we recommend to install the program completely
new.

The major changes were: 
In the hadronic interaction model the charge exchange and
resonance formation have been treated more consistently.  The
leading and antileading particle are treated in the same way.
They may form Delta resonances, rho mesons or K* with immediate
decays according to their branching ratios. This may lead to an
effective charge exchange of the leading or antileading 
particles. The charge exchange and the resonance production are
selected energy dependent and the decays are performed in a way
that the charge of the secondaries is conserved.
Strange baryon production is implemented and the decays of the 
baryons follow the measured branching ratios.
The eta meson production and their decays into neutral particles
are taken into account.
In former versions the transverse momentum and the energy of hadronic
interactions were conserved but not the longitudinal momentum.
Now we adopted the so called Jadach filter to conserve all quantities
at the same time.
The hadronic interaction model (HDPM) has been subdivided into many
subroutines to clarify the structure and to improve the maintenance
and readability.
As muons from pion and kaon decays are polarized the distribution
of there decay electrons may be influenced. Therefore we included
the polarization into the decay of muon and kaon.
Cherenkov radiation from electrons and hadrons has been
implemented following an approach from M. Rozanska, F. Arqueros
and S. Martinez from the HEGRA Collaboration.  The routines 
CERENE and CERENH are called from ELECTR (EGS) and UPDATE for
electrons and hadrons respectively.  As the number of Cherenkov
photons is rather large, only representative subsamples of 
photons are recorded.  Nevertheless there is substantial output
on an additional output file. As the EGS version has to be used
and some accelerating tricks have to be abandoned for Cherenkov
calculations the computing time rises strongly.
There exists a option of the program to simulate showers under
zenith angles up to 90 degrees. To avoid the tracking in spherical
coordinates we adopt a modified density profile of the atmosphere.
The density profiles have to be read from an external dataset.

In addition there were many minor changes and corrections.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.05 : from 13.3. 92 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculation of ATAN in routine NIHILA corrected. First argument
has to be y and second argument x.

New COMMON /MAGNET/ to track all charged particles with earth magnetic
field. Initiation of the magnetic field in START.
New routine UPDATE to perform the tracking with magnetic field.
The EGS routines are effected as well.
BOX2 has been changed to calculate the place of next interaction 
faster and simpler. The decision whether decay or interaction is
moved from NUCINT to BOX2.  New flag FDECAY in COMMON /RUNPAR/ 
tells the routine NUCINT which decision has been taken in BOX2.
In BOX2 in addition some sign errors in the parametrizations of the
cross sections have been corrected and the parametrization has been
smoothed a bit.
Plus some minor changes
All common decks/routines that have been effected by the changes are:
MAGNET, RUNPAR
BOX2, DATAC, EGS, NIHILA, NUCINT, START, UPDATE, VHMESO 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Version 3.04 : from 1.12. 91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main changes in fragmentation fo primary nuclei:
  Optional use of fragmentation model, which keeps all spectator
  nucleons of the first interaction together as a new nucleus. 
  To treat those nuclei one needs the cross section tables for all
  nuclei with A < 56 and the probabilities how many nucleons interact
  in a collision with air nuclei. This rather long table is supported
  in a separate data set.
  In addition we switched to experimentally determined cross sections
  for inelastic hadron - proton collisions including annihilation
  to calculate the distance to the next interaction. 
Commons  ADDCST, HWNPR, PARAM  were no longer needed.
Commons  AIR, NCSNCS, SIGM     were added.
The new option can be chosen in the HADFLG data card as 6th flag,
routine DATAC and START consequently had to be extended.
The contents of common NCSNCS has to be read in routine START from an
external file (on unit 11). It is sent in data set NUCNUCCS.
The subroutines BOX2 and SDPM have been replaced by new ones, 
containing all the changes needed for the new option.
Experimentally available hadron-nucleon cross sections from the particle
data group have been implemented in BOX2 and HDPM, the constants 
C(16), C(17), C(31), C(32), CKA(15) and CKA(16) are no longer used. 
The interaction length statistics for muons has been renamed to decay
length statistics (format in routine OUTPUT).
Routines BOX60 to BOX63 use now the experimental annihilation cross
sections. In NUCINT the new interaction mean free pathes have been
included for pions and kaons. 
Because we do not need longer the common ADDCST the constants CAD(.)
have no longer to be written to the run header. For compatibility 
reasons we keep the structure in the header unchanged.

In routine VHMESO the statement
      IF ( SECPAR(3) .GE. C(29) ) GOTO 7
was wrong. We corrected this error and restructured the treatment of
the angular cuts.

The calculation of EKINL for heavy primaries in routine NUCINT was
wrong. It is now calculated for all particles in the same way.

The calculation of the point of next interaction for particles
with competing decay and interaction has been refined in BOX2.

In the EGS routines, the common CLOCK has been renamed to ACLOCK 
to avoid problems with internal function CLOCK of some compilers.

Some minor changes.

All decks that have been effected by changes since CORSIKA 3.03 are:
DATACRD, EXPLAIN, DPMFLG, NEUTR,
AVAGE, BLOCKDAT, BOX2, BOX60, BOX61, BOX62, BOX63, DATAC, EGS, hdpm,
HMESON, ISOBAR, MITAGE, NIHILA, NUCINT, OUTPUT, SDPM, SINGLE, START,
VHMESO,
AIR, NCSNCS, SIGM
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.03 : from 1.10. 91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variable ELEFT introduced in common ETHMAP.  It contains the sum of
the energy of all particles on the stack.  It is printed out in 
routine OUTPUT with each particle being mapped to see how much 
computing time is still necessary for a long running shower. In
routine OUTPUT the common ETHMAP was added and the printout of
particles has been extended by ELEFT.  In routine ISTACK the commons
ETHMAP and PAM were added and the calculation of the new ELEFT when a
particle was taken from or written to the stack In MAIN the output
format of the header line was changed.

In routine HDPM the statements
C  EXCESS OF CHARGED PARTICLE WHICH COME FROM AIR TARGET
C  IS GIVEN BY SUBROUTINE DIFRAC IN CASE OF DIFFRACTION
        ANCJ = FLOAT(NC1)
have to be moved before the statement
C  CHARGED PARTICLES FROM TARGET
        BNCJ = XZ * ANCJ
        IF (NCH .LE. 1) ISEL=1
      ......

In routine HDPM after the statement
 1009  CONTINUE
the statement
       NCH = NPC
has to be included and before the comment
C  NOW  NCH = (NNC+KKC)*2 + NPC
the statement
       I = I + 1
was missing and has been added.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.02 : from 16.4. 91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid double initialization of coordinates for incident pi 0 in
program MAIN change the statement
          T = -100.
to
          IF ( CURPAR(1) .LE. 3. ) T = -100.

Error in parametrization of position and width of gaussian in routines
DIFRAC and HDPM corrected.
Replace in DIFRAC:
C  WIDTH OF GAUSSIAN FOR THE FRAGMENTATION SYSTEM
      DPI1 = 0.146429D0   * E1LOG + 0.1641717D0
C  POSITION IN CMS OF FRAGMENTATION SYSTEM
      SPI1 = 0.11987884D0 * E1LOG + 0.25484387D0
by the code
C  WIDTH OF GAUSSIAN FOR THE FRAGMENTATION SYSTEM
      DPI1 = 0.11987884D0 * E1LOG + 0.25484387D0
C  POSITION IN CMS OF FRAGMENTATION SYSTEM
      SPI1 = 0.146429D0   * E1LOG + 0.1641717D0
Replace in HDPM :
C  SOME CALCULATION ; FINAL POSITION CALCULATED LATER
      SPIO = 0.11987884D0 * ELABLG + 0.25484387D0
C  WIDTH GAUSSIAN FOR CHARGED SECONDARIES
      DPIO = 0.146429D0 * ELABLG + 0.1641717D0
by the code
C  SOME CALCULATION ; FINAL POSITION CALCULATED LATER
      SPIO = 0.146429D0 * ELABLG + 0.1641717D0
C  WIDTH GAUSSIAN FOR CHARGED SECONDARIES
      DPIO = 0.11987884D0 * ELABLG + 0.25484387D0

All distances in NKG, AVAGE, MITAGE, ININKG have been changed to cm
instead of meters to fit to the rest of the program.
New routine NIHILA giving better kinematics of secondary particles.
Therefore as well the initialization of the array CAN had to be changed.
In routine AVEPT the calculation of ratio of Pt for nucleons, pions and
kaons was changed
      AVPT = 1.D0 + AVPT                                                       
      AVPK = 1.D0 + AVPK
      AVPN = 1.D0 + AVPN
by the statements
C  SET AVERAGE PT RELATED TO AVERAGE PT FOR PIONS
      AVPK = 1.3D0 * AVPK / AVPT
      AVPN = 1.3D0 * AVPN / AVPT
      AVPT = 1.3D0
In subroutine UPHI it is saver to insert
      SAVE A,B,C
The data card input for selecting debug output has been changed.
Now the logical unit for debug output can be chosen, too. The default
value for MDEBUG is 6. The printout in routine START has been slightly
modified and MDEBUG is no longer set in BLOCKDATA.
The routine PIGEN has been changed and the routines
PIGEN1 and PIGEN2 have been added to allow photons
producing one or more hadrons, for high energies via the routine HDPM.
PHOTON, HDPM and SLEAPA have been modified for this reason.
Commented debug statements improved in all EGS routines.
Routine AUSGB2 is now an ENTRY in routine AUSGAB.

Changes in PHOTON
=================
In routine PHOTON after the call to PIGEN
        IF (NP.EQ.0) THEN
         IRCODE=2
         RETURN
        END IF
has to be inserted.

Changes in HDPM
===============
In the beginning of routine HDPM the calculation of ELAB and PLAB has
been modified to
C  CALCULATE LAB AND CM ENERGY
      IF ( ITYPE .EQ. 1 ) THEN
        ELAB = GAMMA
        PLAB = ELAB
        GNU =  1
      ELSE
        ELAB = PAMA(ITYPE) * GAMMA
        PLAB = ELAB * BETA
      ENDIF

The calculation of the number of collisions in target is not performed
for gammas. changed to
C  CHOSE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS IN TARGET ,IF NOT GAMMA INITIATED
      IF ( ITYPE .NE. 1 ) THEN
C  NFLAIN = 1 : AVERAGE INTERACTIONS IN TARGET IS TAKEN
C  NFLAIN = 0 : NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS IN TARGET CHOSEN BY MC
        IF ( NFLAIN .EQ. 1 ) THEN
          GNU = 0.575D0 * (1.D0 + 0.041D0 * ELABLG) * TAR**0.31D0
          IF (DEBUG) WRITE(MDEBUG,*) 'NFLAIN=1 GNU=',GNU
        ELSE 
 .........
 .........
 .........

C  NUMBER OF COLLISIONS IN TARGET
 7332     CONTINUE
          GNU = FLOAT(JL)
        ENDIF
      ENDIF

The calculation of the rapidity of center of mass system in lab has 
been improved
C  RAPIDITY OF CENTER OF MASS SYSTEM IN LAB
      YCM = 0.5D0 * LOG( (ELAB + PAMA(14) + PLAB) /
     *                   (ELAB + PAMA(14) - PLAB) )

Before the return point for wrong calculation an if statement has to 
be introduced. The code looks then like this:
C  EXCESS OF CHARGED PARTICLE WHICH COME FROM AIR TARGET
      ANCI0 = 2. * VNEG0
C  FOR GAMMA-INDUCED REACTION TAKE PI0 AS LEADING PARTICLE
      IF ( ITYPE .EQ. 1 ) ITYPE = 7

C  RETURN POINT IF CALCULATION OF PARTICLES GOES WRONG
  1   CONTINUE

Diffractive interactions are forbidden for gamma induced interactions.
Now the comment and the if statement has to be changed to:
C  NO DIFFRACTION IF
C           THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS IN TARGET IS CHOSEN RANDOMLY 
C     AND   MORE THAN ONE INTERACTION TAKES PLACE
C  OR       PRIMARY PARTICLE IS GAMMA (PI0)
C  NOW NFLDIF DECIDES WETHER DIFFRACTIVE PROCESS POSSIBLE OR NOT
      IF ( ( NFLAIN.EQ.0 .AND. GNU.GT.1.D0 .AND. NFLDIF.EQ.0 )
     *      .OR. ( ITYPE .EQ. 7 ) ) THEN
        IDIF = 0 
      ELSE

Charge exchange reactions for incident PI0s is included after the call
of SLEAPA
            IF ( RD(1) .LE. CHFF ) CALL SLEAPA
          ELSEIF ( ITYPE. EQ. 7 ) THEN
C  TEST IF CHARGE EXCHANGE REACTION FOR PI0
C  ASSUME 50% CHARGE EXCHANGE FOR GAMMA INITIATED INTERACTION
            CALL RMMAR(RD,1,1)
            IF ( RD(1) .LE. 0.5 ) CALL SLEAPA
          ENDIF
        ENDIF 

Changes in SLEAPA
=================
Charge exchange for pi0 is added:
      IF ( RD(1) .LE. 0.5 ) THEN

C  REACTION WITH NEUTRON (CHARGE EXCHANGE ALLOWED FOR PI0 PI+ K+ K0)
C  NEUTRON ALWAYS CHANGED TO PROTON
C  CHARGE EXCHANGE FLAG IFRA IS SET

C  PI0 + NEUTRON  --> PI- + PROTON
        IF     ( LEPAR1 .EQ. 7 ) THEN
          LEPAR1 = 9
          LEPAR2 = 14
          IFRA = 1
C  PI+ + NEUTRON  --> PI0 + PROTON
        ELSEIF ( LEPAR1 .EQ. 8 ) THEN
      ..........
      ..........
      ..........
      ELSE

C  REACTION WITH PROTON (CHARGE EXCHANGE ALLOWED FOR pi0 PI- K- K0)
C  PROTON ALWAYS CHANGED TO NEUTRON
C  CHARGE EXCHANGE FLAG IFRA IS SET

C  PI0 + PROTON  --> PI+ + NEUTRON
        IF     ( LEPAR1 .EQ. 7 ) THEN
          LEPAR1 = 8 
          LEPAR2 = 13
          IFRA = 1
C  PI- + PROTON  --> PI0 + NEUTRON
        ELSEIF ( LEPAR1 .EQ. 9 ) THEN
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.01 : from 28.1. 91

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid the high values in the printout of the electron lateral
distribution from NKG (Union Jack) replace the 2 divisions in
the following statement in routine AVAGE by multiplications.

========================================================================

History :

a first version of the simulation program consisted of a program of
P.K.F. Grieder for hadronic interactions at energies below 10 GeV,
a dual parton model based routine (according J.N. Capdevielle) to
simulate high energetic hadronic interactions and the NKG formulas
for treating gammas from pi 0 decays. The structure of the atmosphere
was used in a parametrization from J. Linsley. To allow for nucleus-
nucleus and nucleon-nucleus collisions a simple model was applied
based on nuclear densities.

This program (CTG58) was used to simulate a first set of data.
