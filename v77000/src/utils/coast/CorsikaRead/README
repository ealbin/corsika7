This is an example for a COAST based CORSIKA binary output file 
reader. It explains in 2 steps, how to use the create an executable
to read CORSIKA output and convert it to ASCII (CorsikaReader) or 
ROOT (CorsikaPlotter) file.


Step 1:
-------

Compile COAST libraries by selecting option "d1" in 'coconut' (other options 
are not important at this stage) and compile CORSIKA a first time.

Step 2:
-------

If you need it, edit CorsikaReader.cc or CorsikaPlotter.cc to do what you want.
Makefile is defined to compile both CorsikaPlotter.cc (with ROOT) and a
simple ASCII output with CorsikaReader.cc by default. If ROOT is not installed
only CorsikaReader will be compiled. You can compile only one using "make 
plotter" or "make reader".

-------

The executable file CorsikaPlotter (or CorsikaReader) is created and you 
can simply use it with :
CorsikaPlotter DATxxxxxx
