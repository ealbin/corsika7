This is the default standard example for a "COAST user
library". It explains in 3 steps, how to use the COAST_USER_LIB
option of CORSIKA


Step 1:
-------

Compile this example with 'make', with one of the two options:

a) The Makefile assumes that you are currently working in the 
   direction 'coast/CorsikaOptions/example'. If this is the case it
   will work. If not, read option b)

b) Define COAST_DIR environment variable to the location of your existing 
   CORSIKA installation. Check that 'ls $COAST_DIR/include/interface' 
   contains the file 'CorsikaInterface.h'. If this is not the case, this
   is not a valid or proper installation of CORSIKA. First compile CORSIKA!

Look at 'coast.cc' to understand how COAST works...


Step 2:
-------

Create COAST_USER_LIB environment variable to point at your current
directory, where now the 'libCOAST.so' library is located.
Add the path in $COAST_USER_LIB to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.


Step 3:
-------

Go back to your CORSIKA directory and re-start 'coconut'. The option
COAST_USER_LIB will now be visible. Please select it, copile CORSIKA
and start the executable. In the generated console output you will the
statements from your COAST library during Init and Close of the
simulation.  
Add any kind of code now working on the CParticle or
CInteraction class to start using the full power of COAST.
